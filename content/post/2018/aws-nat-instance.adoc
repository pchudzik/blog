At work and in my private time I'm trying to get myself familiar with AWS cloud. Almost all of this
is new for me. I know how to setup few things using AWS web console but infrastructure as a code was
calling to me and I wanted to give it a spin. My first task was to create VPC with two pairs of
subnets for private stuff and here is why I did it twice.

<!--more-->

I've started very ambitiously with blank yml file and cloudformation documentation opened. After
reading few pages I needed a break because it wasn't exactly what I was hoping for. I was looking
forward to set up my infrastructure in few lines of yml. That is how AWS is advertising this
anyway... My guess is that few lines of code are very relative amount ;) So I needed to change the
tactic I've started by looking at templates from the documentation and then did some digging to look
on the internet for what I wanted to do.

I've found the template which fitted my needs almost perfectly. After few tweaks, I've deployed it
on the AWS and I was almost proud of myself. My first cloudformation script and I've got VPC, 2
public, and 2 private subnets, ECS cluster, task definitions, services, autoscaling, magic ;)
Luckily I've configured bill alert...

While setting up LanchConfiguration for autoscaling group I've made sure to use free tier eligible
t2.micro instances but I didn't check costs for NAT gateways which are pretty high (at least for me,
where I've got two dockers running on ECS and doing basically nothing). I'm very cheap and the first
thing I did was remove the stack ;) Next, I've started to look for the pricing and what I can do
about it. I've noticed that you can use NAT  instance instead of NAT getaway. A quick look at the
pricing - it will be cheaper (now I'm looking for savings, not for reliability). I've found some
examples and instructions on how to configure it using cloudformation templates but it wasn't
working so good for me (copy paste method has failed) and as a result, I was forced to dig a little
deeper and find out on my own how to set it up properly...

My experience with AWS is close to zero and if you decide to use something from this post and your
production goes to hell you are on your own. All I can guarantee is that it works for me.

Let's start with the obvious and let's set up VPC with Internet Gateway and two subnets:

{{<highlight YAML>}}
VPC:
  Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
  Properties:
    CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/24
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: !Sub VPC ${pEnvironmentName}
InternetGateway:
  Type: AWS::EC2::InternetGateway
  Properties:
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName} Internet Gateway
InternetGatewayAttachment:
  Type: AWS::EC2::VPCGatewayAttachment
  Properties:
    InternetGatewayId: !Ref InternetGateway
    VpcId: !Ref VPC
SubnetPublic1:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
  Properties:
    CidrBlock: 10.0.0.0/26
    MapPublicIpOnLaunch: true
    AvailabilityZone: !Select [ 0, !GetAZs ]
    VpcId: !Ref VPC
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName} Public Subnet (AZ1)
SubnetPublic2:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
  Properties:
    CidrBlock: 10.0.0.64/26
    MapPublicIpOnLaunch: true
    AvailabilityZone: !Select [ 1, !GetAZs ]
    VpcId: !Ref VPC
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName} Public Subnet (AZ2)
SubnetPrivate1:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
  Properties:
    CidrBlock: 10.0.0.128/26
    MapPublicIpOnLaunch: false
    AvailabilityZone: !Select [ 0, !GetAZs ]
    VpcId: !Ref VPC
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName} Private Subnet (AZ1)
SubnetPrivate2:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Subnet
    Properties:
      MapPublicIpOnLaunch: false
      CidrBlock: 10.0.0.192/26
      AvailabilityZone: !Select [ 1, !GetAZs ]
      VpcId: !Ref VPC
      Tags:
        - Key: Name
          Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName} Private Subnet (AZ2)
{{</highlight>}}

The easy part was done. Now harder bit. Let's configure EC2 instance which will be used as a NAT
Gateway. Luckily you don't need to be iptables/or whatever magician to have set it up. AWS
configured the instance for this. All you need to do is find proper AMI id and you are good to go.
But before we can start with EC2 we have to configure security group for the NAT instance:

{{<highlight YAML>}}
NatInstanceSercurityGroup:
  Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
  Properties:
    VpcId: !Ref VPC
    GroupDescription: Access to the nat instnace
    SecurityGroupIngress:
      # http & https trafic
      - CidrIp: 10.0.0.128/25
        FromPort: 80
        ToPort: 80
        IpProtocol: tcp
      - CidrIp: 10.0.0.128/25
        FromPort: 443
        ToPort: 443
        IpProtocol: tcp
      #ssh access
      - CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
        FromPort: 22
        ToPort: 22
        IpProtocol: tcp
      # routing
      - CidrIp: 10.0.0.128/25
        IpProtocol: icmp
        FromPort: -1
        ToPort: -1
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName}-Nat-SecurityGrouop
{{</highlight>}}

To quickly wrap it up:

- port 80 and 443 are to allow EC2 instances in private subnet to access the internet.
- port 22 is for SSH access (it is easier to debug it when you can just login into the machine and
see what is going on and when it is starting to work). You can also use nat instance as a hop
machine.
- protocol ICMP is to allow ec2 instances to ask NAT instance for routing and stuff.

Now I need an AMI id. I can use eu-central-1 image id and get it over with but I wanted to play a
bit more with AWS API and as a result, I've written a very simple script which has found AMI id for
all the regions in few seconds:

{{<highlight bash>}}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

NAME_FILTER=$1

REGIONS=( us-east-2 us-east-1 us-west-2 us-west-1 eu-west-3 eu-west-2 eu-west-1 eu-central-1 ap-northeast-2 ap-northeast-1 ap-southeast-2 ap-southeast-1 ca-central-1 ap-south-1 sa-east-1 )
for region in "${REGIONS[@]}"; do
  IMAGES=`aws ec2 describe-images --filters Name=name,Values=${NAME_FILTER} Name=virtualization-type,Values=hvm --owners amazon --region ${region}`
  AMI_TO_USE=`echo ${IMAGES} | jq .Images | jq -c 'sort_by(.CreationDate) | .[-1]'`
  IMAGE_ID=`echo ${AMI_TO_USE} | jq -r .ImageId`
  IMAGE_NAME=`echo ${AMI_TO_USE} | jq -r .Name`

  echo "$region:"
  echo "    AMI: ${IMAGE_ID} # ${IMAGE_NAME}"
done
{{</highlight>}}

With the mapping for AMI id in place I can setup EC2 instance:

{{<highlight yaml>}}
NatInstance1:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
  Properties:
    InstanceType: !Ref pNatInstanceType
    ImageId: !FindInMap [mAWSRegionToAMI, !Ref "AWS::Region", AMI]
    SourceDestCheck: false
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
      Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName} NAT1 instance
    KeyName: !Ref pSshKey
    NetworkInterfaces:
      - SubnetId: !Ref SubnetPublic1
      GroupSet:
        - !Ref NatInstanceSercurityGroup
      AssociatePublicIpAddress: true
      DeviceIndex: 0
NatInstance2:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
  Properties:
    InstanceType: !Ref pNatInstanceType
    ImageId: !FindInMap [mAWSRegionToAMI, !Ref "AWS::Region", AMI]
    SourceDestCheck: false
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
      Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName} NAT2 instance
    KeyName: !Ref pSshKey
    NetworkInterfaces:
      - SubnetId: !Ref SubnetPublic2
      GroupSet:
        - !Ref NatInstanceSercurityGroup
      AssociatePublicIpAddress: true
      DeviceIndex: 0
{{</highlight>}}

With ec2 configured I can now setup routing:

{{<highlight yaml>}}
PublicRouteTable:
  Type: AWS::EC2::RouteTable
  Properties:
    VpcId: !Ref VPC
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName} Public Routes
DefaultPublicRoute:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Route
  DependsOn: InternetGatewayAttachment
  Properties:
    RouteTableId: !Ref PublicRouteTable
    DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
    GatewayId: !Ref InternetGateway
PublicSubnet1RouteTableAssociation:
  Type: AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation
  Properties:
    RouteTableId: !Ref PublicRouteTable
    SubnetId: !Ref SubnetPublic1
PublicSubnet2RouteTableAssociation:
  Type: AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation
  Properties:
    RouteTableId: !Ref PublicRouteTable
    SubnetId: !Ref SubnetPublic2
PrivateRouteTable1:
  Type: AWS::EC2::RouteTable
  Properties:
    VpcId: !Ref VPC
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName} Private Routes (AZ1)
DefaultPrivateRoute1:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Route
  Properties:
    RouteTableId: !Ref PrivateRouteTable1
    DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
    InstanceId: !Ref NatInstance1
PrivateSubnet1RouteTableAssociation:
  Type: AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation
  Properties:
    RouteTableId: !Ref PrivateRouteTable1
    SubnetId: !Ref SubnetPrivate1
PrivateRouteTable2:
  Type: AWS::EC2::RouteTable
  Properties:
    VpcId: !Ref VPC
    Tags:
      - Key: Name
        Value: !Sub ${pEnvironmentName} Private Routes (AZ2)
DefaultPrivateRoute2:
  Type: AWS::EC2::Route
  Properties:
    RouteTableId: !Ref PrivateRouteTable2
    DestinationCidrBlock: 0.0.0.0/0
    InstanceId: !Ref NatInstance2
PrivateSubnet2RouteTableAssociation:
  Type: AWS::EC2::SubnetRouteTableAssociation
  Properties:
    RouteTableId: !Ref PrivateRouteTable2
    SubnetId: !Ref SubnetPrivate2
{{</highlight>}}

And that is all. With above cloud formation template You'll land with VPC, two private and two
public subnets and with EC2s serving as a NAT instance. As you can see infrastructure as a code is
not so bad and allows you to quickly setup everything you might need with few clicks or one API
call. Next step will be to use this as a base for your actual infrastructure ;) One thing that
bothers me though is that now I'm fixed on using AWS cloud and migration to any other cloud provider
will require full rewriting of this stuff. In the future, I'm going to dig deeper into this issue.

Full cloud formation script can be found on my
https://github.com/pchudzik/blog-example-aws-nat-instance/blob/master/nat-instance.template.yml[GitHub].
