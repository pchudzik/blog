While working on private stuff I've encountered a moment when I was in need to create a web-based
user interface for the application I've been developing lately. In this post, I'm going to briefly
describe why I've decided to use Node.js for generating HTML on the server side and how I've taken
advantage of the javascript on the server and in the browser.

<!--more-->

Once my backend API was more or less in place I've decided it is time to do something about the user
interface. I've started from evaluating possible options. Let me give you some context. I need a web
interface for something that might die and I don't want to spent too much time on this. On the other
hand, if it gets lit I'll have to maintain it for some time or at least before I rewrite it to
something less hacky :)

I've quickly dropped the idea of creating rich web client using angular or react because it is a lot
of work to create a solid application using modern js those technologies. I think react and angular
are great solutions for creating web applications, but I don't really need full-blown app right now.
Starting with angular/react basically means that you are forced to always chase the technology and
it will always be ahead of you ;) What's more although angular is developed by company which started
from creating search engine it is not indexed very good by the Google (sure you can work around this
problem, but I'm not ready to spend too much time on creating workarounds for the system that does
not exists yet) neither is react.

My second idea was to use java/groovy (basically everything from JSF, wicket, GWT (isn't it dead
yet?) to more static template based stuff). I don't like the idea of writing frontend in the backend
language. What's more java and groovy are far from perfect for prototyping because you have to write
a lot of code to do simple stuff (groovy is actually ok, but I think there are better options).

I've considered using ruby/python/whatever to generate HTML. Same as with java - backend language
for generating frontend code doesn't sound right for me. What's more, I barely know python, I don't
know ruby and "whatever" is really hard to define ;) It might be nice to learn something new along
the way but I don't want to learn a new language while doing stuff that I no longer enjoy doing.

Finally, I've decided to use https://nodejs.org/en/[Node.js] along with
https://expressjs.com/[Express.js] and https://pugjs.org[pug.js] template engine. Node.js is
javascript and browsers do like javascript :) From my previous experiences node is great prototyping
tool.

While I was hacking quick POC I decided to try and implement yet another crazy idea. Sometimes full
page reload doesn't make a lot of sense especially when you are adding an item to the list of items.
Since I was using javascript on the backend and javascript in the browser I've decided to use the
same template on the frontend and on the backend. After quick research, I was able to do it and use
exactly the same template for generating UI on the client and server side :)

I've seen my share of ${}, {{}} or another weird syntax which allows mixing HTML with something else
I wanted to try something new. The library I decided to use is named pug.js it has a tool called
https://github.com/pugjs/pug-cli[pug-cli] which compiles templates to the pure javascript functions
which can be included and invoked in the browser. You probably already know where I'm going with
this. I created small reusable templates and with them, I was able to quickly generate HTML in the
backend and use the same template to do some ajax on the client side without duplicating layout code
in the client javascript :)

Let me show how ugly it is ;) I've created a simple application using an express generator. Note
that it generates old fashion javascript and you can safely use a lot of sugar from es6 in node8.

{{<highlight bash>}}
npm install express-generator && cd sample
./node_modules/.bin/express --view pug --css sass --git sample
{{</highlight>}}

I quickly hacked API which allows to list, add and remove "users":

{{<highlight javascript>}}
const
  express = require('express'),
  router = express.Router();

router.get('/', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });
router.get('/:id', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });
router.post('/', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });
router.delete('/:id', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });
router.put('/:id', (req, res) => { /* ... */ });

module.exports = router;
{{</highlight>}}

https://github.com/pchudzik/blog-example-express-pug/blob/master/routes/usersApi.js

Next, I've created two endpoints to list all users and display details of a single user:

{{<highlight javascript>}}

const
  express = require('express'),
  router = express.Router(),
  axios = require('axios');

router.get('/', function (req, res) {
  axios
    .get('http://localhost:3000/api/users')
    .then(unwrapResponseData)
    .then(users => res.render('users', {users: users}));
});

router.get('/:id', (req, res) => {
  axios
    .get('http://localhost:3000/api/users/' + req.params.id)
    .then(unwrapResponseData)
    .then(user => res.render('userDetails', {user}));
});

function unwrapResponseData(response) {
  return response.data;
}

module.exports = router;
{{</highlight>}}

Now it is time to do write templates for this stuff. First, let's list all users and add an option
to create user and button to remove a particular resource from the list without doing page reload:

{{<highlight jade>}}
extends layout

block content
  h1 users list

  include userCreateForm

  ul#allUsers
    each user in users
      include singleUser
{{</highlight>}}

Note that pug/jade is very compact, and name suggest exactly what to expect from it :P Let's take a
look at singleUser.pug which will be included for each user entry:

{{<highlight jade>}}
li.userItem(id='user' + user.id)
  a(href='/users/' + user.id)
    span.id= user.id
    =" "
    span.firstName= user.firstName
    =" "
    span.lastName= user.lastName
  input(type='button', value='Delete user', id='user' + user.id + 'Remove')

  script.
    $('#user#{user.id}Remove').click(function () {
      $.ajax({
        url: 'http://localhost:3000/api/users/#{user.id}',
        type: 'DELETE',
        success: function () {
          $('#user#{user.id}').remove();
        }
      });
    });
{{</highlight>}}

Nothing fancy list username, and add a button to remove the user. Now create user form which is a
bit more interesting:

{{<highlight jade>}}
form#userCreateForm
  p
    | User first name
    input#userFirstName(type='text')
  p
    | User last name
    input#userLastName(type='text')
  p
    input#userSave(type='submit', value='Save')

script(src='javascripts/views/singleUser.js')
script.
  $(document).ready(function () {
    $('#userCreateForm').submit(function () {
      $.post(
        'http://localhost:3000/api/users',
        {
          firstName: $('#userFirstName').val(),
          lastName: $('#userLastName').val()
        },
        function (response) {
          $('#allUsers').append(singleuserTemplate({user: response}));
        });
    });
  });
{{</highlight>}}

The javascript included in this file is the core of the idea :) it is executing post request and
passes the response back to the singleUser template. I don't need to duplicate information how
single user HTML looks like. I can easily reuse the same template which was used on the server side
to quickly generate the same HTML on the client side. Sure there are drawbacks and restrictions, but
I believe that with a bit of a planning it might actually work.

I was able to achieve it using pug.js and updating package.json scripts section a bit:

{{<highlight json>}}
{
  "scripts": {
    "start": "pug -c --name-after-file -o public/javascripts/views views && node ./bin/www",
    "dev": "concurrently -k \"nodemon ./bin/www\" \"pug -c -w --name-after-file -o public/javascripts/views views\""
  },
}
{{</highlight>}}

Note that package.json is only basic example. In real life you'd probably want to merge multiple
templates into single file and add other stuff which will speed up build process.

Since I'm barely starting I don't know how it will work in the future but I'm pretty sure that I'll
be able to hack something working using this approach really fast. I wouldn't recommend this for big
applications but it is something which will allow to prototype UI quickly. To avoid dropping
everything I did in the future I'm going to write integration tests which I'll be able to reuse no
matter how UI stack will look like in case I'll have to rewrite it to something more civilized ;)
