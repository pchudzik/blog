While deep diving into the code I very often see people struggle when testing random
changing/things. There is a really simple solution for this and in this blog post, I'm going to show
you https://xkcd.com/221/["one simple trick"] that will fix this problem.

<!--more-->

tl;dr - Use dependency injection. Inject source of changing data from the outside and make it return
a fixed value. Voil√† it is done.

Let's start with something simple - time. Every time you check it, it will be different. Even if
your precision is like a second, minute or even a day there will be a time when your tests will fail
because they've been executed at the wrong moment. To avoid looking for too far-fetched example
let's say you need to implement a time-limited discount for a product.


{{<highlight java>}}
import java.time.Clock;
import java.time.LocalDateTime;

class DiscountService {
  private final Clock clock;

  DiscountService(Clock clock) {
    this.clock = clock;
  }

  public boolean isActive(Discount discount) {
    final LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now(clock);
    return discount.startDate.isAfter(now) && discount.endDate.isBefore(now);
  }

  static class Discount {
    private final LocalDateTime startDate;
    private final LocalDateTime endDate;

    Discount(LocalDateTime startDate, LocalDateTime endDate) {
      this.startDate = startDate;
      this.endDate = endDate;
    }
  }
}
{{</highlight>}}

And the simple test for the above class:

{{<highlight java>}}
public class DiscountServiceTest {
  private final long nowMilliseconds = 1521056135184L;
  private final Clock fixedClock = Clock.fixed(
      Instant.ofEpochMilli(nowMilliseconds),
      ZoneId.systemDefault());
  private final LocalDateTime now = LocalDateTime.now(fixedClock);

  private final DiscountService discountService = new DiscountService(fixedClock);

  @Test
  public void should_be_inactive_when_before_start_date() {
    final LocalDateTime tomorrow = now.plusDays(1);
    final LocalDateTime dayAfterTomorrow = tomorrow.plusDays(1);

    assertFalse(discountService.isActive(new Discount(tomorrow, dayAfterTomorrow)));
  }

  @Test
  public void should_be_inactive_when_after_end_date() {
    final LocalDateTime yesterday = now.minusDays(1);
    final LocalDateTime dayBeforeYesterday = yesterday.minusDays(1);

    assertFalse(discountService.isActive(new Discount(dayBeforeYesterday, yesterday)));
  }

  @Test
  public void should_be_active_when_after_start_and_before_end_date() {
    final LocalDateTime yesterday = now.minusDays(1);
    final LocalDateTime tomorrow = now.plusDays(1);

    assertFalse(discountService.isActive(new Discount(yesterday, now)));
  }
}
{{</highlight>}}

This is really simple you might say and you are sure that it is not worth the trouble. Well, maybe
it isn't maybe it is? How long will discount last in a leap February, are you going to wait until
February in next two years to check it? How are you going to verify that complicated business logic
based on current time works? How do you know if the scheduled job will be executed exactly when you
need? What will happen with job executed on 30 th day of a month in February?

(Clock is for Java 8+ in older java versions we used to inject something which we called
TimeProvider with method now() and it worked the same as a clock for time provider)

The same is with random stuff. Testing randomness might be even more tricky because when something
is random it usually means that your decision depends on it (unless it is some kind of UUID used as
a key which I also implemented with IdGenerator or something like this to avoid static calls ;)).
How are you going to verify if your calculation for mage attack points works? You can either hope
for the best or simply provide the source of randomness from the outside and make it return fixed
value while testing.

{{<highlight java>}}
class Mage {
  static final int ATTACK_FACTOR = 5;
  private int baseAttack;

  public Mage(int baseAttack) {
    this.baseAttack = baseAttack;
  }

  public int attack(Random random) {
    final int attackFactor = random.nextInt((ATTACK_FACTOR + 1));
    final int extraAttackPoints = attackFactor == 0 ? 0 : baseAttack / attackFactor;
    return baseAttack + extraAttackPoints;
  }
}
{{</highlight>}}

Tests for calculating maximum and minimum attack points:

{{<highlight java>}}
public class MageAttackTest {
  private final int minAttackFactor = 0;
  private final int maxAttackFactor = Mage.ATTACK_FACTOR;

  @Test
  public void should_have_at_least_base_attack_strength() {
    //given
    final int baseAttack = 100;

    //when
    final int attackPoints = new Mage(baseAttack).attack(fixedRandom(minAttackFactor));

    //then
    assertEquals(baseAttack, attackPoints);
  }

  @Test
  public void should_have_up_to_20_percent_more_attack_strength() {
    //given
    final int baseAttack = 100;

    //when
    final int attackPoints = new Mage(baseAttack).attack(fixedRandom(maxAttackFactor));

    //then
    assertEquals(baseAttack + 20, attackPoints);
  }

  private Random fixedRandom(int number) {
    return new Random() {
      @Override
      public int nextInt(int bound) {
        return number;
      }
    };
  }
}
{{</highlight>}}

Sometimes you can not just inject something into a field of your class. Instead of doing some weird
hacks to make it happen just inject fixed implementation as method parameter as I did above.

The solution is very simple, but very often I see LocalDateDate.now() called somewhere inside
business method and I cringe every time because I've spent a lot of time to get rid of something
like this (don't ask it was long time ago...) to pinpoint and fix a bug which was time-related...
