We are improving cache in the project Im working on. In the code base I've found a method which
accepted a collection of ids and returned collection of objects for those ids. My goal was to add
cache on individual values returned by the method. Creation of items was IO heavy and time-consuming
operation so removal of cache was not an option.

<!--more-->

I'm working with old system and logic for loading and invalidating values was complicated and
scattered across many places. To change this serious refactoring would be needed so I've decided to
leave it be, but to improve codebase a bit and fix cache layer (code of various business operations
was mixed with native Ehcache API calls).

I wanted to cache items separately because it was up to the user to decide what elements he wants to
access and “up to him to decide” what elements should be invalidated. The main challenge was in the
way the cache was used. If you image your method as something like (called from different places and
invalidated in other on single item basis):

{{<highlight java>}}
List<Item> findItems(Collection<UUID> ids)
{{</highlight>}}

It’s been called from different places like (and always invalidated for single element):

{{<highlight java>}}
findItems(asList(1,2,3));
findItems(asList(1));
findItems(asList(2,3))
{{</highlight>}}

My first concept was to implement this caching mechanism using
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.15.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html[spring’s
cache abstraction], but it is based on a pretty simple idea and it does not allow such behavior,
even with a
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/4.3.15.RELEASE/spring-framework-reference/html/cache.html#cache-annotations-cacheable-key[custom
key generator], all you can do is to convert input arguments to something different, not to mention
invalidate single value from cached collection... Spring cache abstraction doesn’t solve the problem
for me :( Because of that I had to improvise a bit and solve the issue by myself.

As we are using Redis for caching I’ve decided that this is vendor lock I’m willing to live with,
but firstly I’ve created abstraction so there will be only one place to change in case we’ll need to
pick different cache vendor and we will not have to worry about implementation details and how to
use the cache in the future except this one class responsible for it.

{{<highlight java>}}
interface ItemsCache {
    List<Item> findItems(Collection<UUID> ids);

    void saveItems(Collection<Item> items);
}
{{</highlight>}}

In reality there was more but let's keep it simple.

Next, all I had to do was implement a basic caching mechanism using  spring’s
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/redis/core/RedisTemplate.html[RedisTemplate].
I’ve started from writing tests to avoid rebooting application or cleaning up Redis every time I’ve
messed something up (serialization of those objects to JSON was not so easy as those were pretty
complex and big structures...):

{{<highlight java>}}
@Test
public void items_are_loaded_from_cache() {
    //given
    final Item item1 = anyItem();
    final Item item2 = anyItem();
    Mockito
            .when(slowItemRepository.get(item1.getId()))
            .thenReturn(item1);
    Mockito
            .when(slowItemRepository.get(item2.getId()))
            .thenReturn(item2);

    //when
    itemsService.findItems(singleton(item1.getId()));
    itemsService.findItems(singleton(item2.getId()));
    itemsService.findItems(asList(item1.getId(), item2.getId()));

    //then
    Mockito.verify(slowItemRepository, times(1)).get(item1.getId());
    Mockito.verify(slowItemRepository, times(1)).get(item2.getId());
}

@Test
public void ttl_is_set_on_items() {
    //given
    final Item item = anyItem();
    Mockito
            .when(slowItemRepository.get(item.getId()))
            .thenReturn(item);

    //when
    itemsService.findItems(singleton(item.getId()));

    //then
    long ttl = jedisConnectionFactory.getConnection().pTtl(("Item:" + item.getId()).getBytes());
    Assert.assertTrue(ttl > 0);
}
{{</highlight>}}

The last step was to write actual implementation of the service:

{{<highlight java>}}
@Service
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class ItemsService {
    private final SlowItemRepository repository;
    private final ItemsCache itemsCache;

    public List<Item> findItems(Collection<UUID> ids) {
        final List<Item> foundInCache = itemsCache.findItems(ids);
        final List<Item> notCached = loadMissingItems(ids, foundInCache);

        final List<Item> result = Stream
                .concat(foundInCache.stream(), notCached.stream())
                .collect(toList());

        itemsCache.saveItems(notCached);

        return result;
    }

    private List<Item> loadMissingItems(Collection<UUID> ids, List<Item> foundInCache) {
        final Set<UUID> cachedIds = foundInCache.stream()
                .map(Item::getId)
                .collect(Collectors.toSet());
        return ids.stream()
                .filter(id -> !cachedIds.contains(id))
                .map(this::lookupInRepository)
                .collect(toList());
    }

    private Item lookupInRepository(UUID id) {
        return repository.get(id);
    }
}
{{</highlight>}}

And caching itself:

{{<highlight java>}}
@Component
@RequiredArgsConstructor
public class ItemsCacheImpl implements ItemsCache {
    private final RedisTemplate<String, Item> redisTemplate;

    @Override
    public List<Item> findItems(Collection<UUID> ids) {
        final List<Item> result = redisTemplate.opsForValue()
                .multiGet(ids.stream().map(this::generateCacheKey).collect(toList()))
                .stream()
                .filter(Objects::nonNull)
                .collect(toList());

        refreshTTL(result);

        return result;
    }

    @Override
    public void saveItems(Collection<Item> items) {
        redisTemplate.opsForValue()
                .multiSet(items.stream()
                        .collect(Collectors.toMap(
                                item -> generateCacheKey(item.getId()),
                                Function.identity())));
        refreshTTL(items);
    }

    private void refreshTTL(Collection<Item> result) {
        redisTemplate.executePipelined((SessionCallback) callback -> {
            result.stream()
                    .map(item -> generateCacheKey(item.getId()))
                    .forEach(key -> callback.expire(key, 10, TimeUnit.MINUTES));
            return null;
        });
    }

    private String generateCacheKey(UUID id) {
        return "Item:" + id;
    }
}
{{</highlight>}}

As Redis provides commands to https://redis.io/commands/mget[get] and
https://redis.io/commands/mset[set] operations that allow to look for or store multiple objects at
once implementation turned out not to be so complicated.

When I started working on it, at first I was afraid that I’ll have to write a lot of low-level code
to make it work but luckily with spring’s
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/redis/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/redis/core/RedisTemplate.html[RedisTemplate]
it turned out not to be so ugly nor complicated after all. A bit of legacy code allowed mu to get to
know what spring has to offer in terms of integration with redis, which turned out to be pretty easy
to work with ;)
