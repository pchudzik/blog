Have you ever wondered how spring does things? How field annotated with `@Autowired` is populated?
How asynchronous or scheduled methods are discovered. In this post, I’m going to take a deeper look
and scratch a bit on the surface of spring internals. I'll focus on `BeanPostProcessor` interface
which can be used to achieve interesting things and is used in many various functionalities across
spring framework itself.

Spring container boot process

Let's take a look at the spring boot process which can give us a hint on how important part of the
framework this hook is.

{{<highlight java>}}
@Override
public void refresh() throws BeansException, IllegalStateException {
    synchronized (this.startupShutdownMonitor) {
        prepareRefresh();

        ConfigurableListableBeanFactory beanFactory = obtainFreshBeanFactory();
        prepareBeanFactory(beanFactory);

        try {
            postProcessBeanFactory(beanFactory);
            invokeBeanFactoryPostProcessors(beanFactory);
            registerBeanPostProcessors(beanFactory);
            initMessageSource();
            initApplicationEventMulticaster();
            onRefresh();
            registerListeners();
            finishBeanFactoryInitialization(beanFactory);
            finishRefresh();
        } catch (BeansException ex) {
            destroyBeans();
            cancelRefresh(ex);
            throw ex;
        } finally {
            resetCommonCaches();
        }
    }
}

To quickly recap how things are happening during spring context initialization. Firstly all beans
definitions are registered in `BeanFactory` then `BeanFactoryPostprocessors` are applied on the
`BeanFactory` (this is the moment when you can change definitions of beans registered in
`BeanFactory` and I will dig into this some other day). Next step is registration of
`BeanPostProcessors`. Those registered `BeanPostProcessors` are executed at a later time when
someone is actually requesting bean to be created/retrieved from IoC container - when they are
needed
(https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/v5.1.4.RELEASE/spring-beans/src/main/java/org/springframework/beans/factory/support/FactoryBeanRegistrySupport.java#L203[FactoryBeanRegistrySupport#postProcessObjectFromFactoryBean]).

BeanPostProcessor interface

{{<highlight java>}}
public interface BeanPostProcessor {
	@Nullable
	default Object postProcessBeforeInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
		return bean;
	}

	@Nullable
	default Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
		return bean;
	}
}
{{</highlight>}}

This hook allows customization of bean instance just after bean creation or after it's been
initialized. All `BeanPostProcessor` which are annotated or declared (anyone remembers xmls?) will
be automatically recognized and picked up by the framework when it definitions are registered.

As you can see there are only two methods in this interface: `postProcessBeforeInitialization` and
`postProcesAfterInitialization` as the name suggest first method is executed before the bean init
code (`@PostConstruct` or `afterPropertiesSet` hook). After initialization hook is executed when the
bean has been initialized (after `afterPropertiesSet` or `@PostConstruct`). Extra area of
possibilities is presented to the users because `BeanPostProcessor` hook is executed also on
`FactoryBean` instances so you can customize objects even before they are created (kind off). If you
want to short-circuit processing of your bean you can simply return `null` from postProcessor and
processing chain will be broken which means no more of them will be applied.

Sample usage

We already know a bit on how it works now let’s try and implement something to take advantage of
this interface. Imagine that you want to hack some measurements of your application performance. For
the sake of example, we can do very naive implementation using just a couple of lines of code. Let's
assume that I want to measure method execution times, but not all of them, just some of them
annotated with following marker interface:

{{<highlight java>}}
@Target(ElementType.METHOD)
@Retention(RetentionPolicy.RUNTIME)
@interface Measured {
    String DEFAULT_PERFORMANCE_LOGGER = "PERFORMANCE";

    String value() default DEFAULT_PERFORMANCE_LOGGER;
}
{{</highlight>}}

Not much is happening in here yet. It's just an interface which will be detected at runtime
(`@Retention(RUNTIME)`) and can be applied on method level (`@Target(METHOD)`). We'll be using it to
detect methods on which we'll be doing extra measurements.

With this annotation in place we can already create very simple service:

{{<highlight java>}}
@Service
class SampleService {
    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SampleService.class);

    @Measured
    public void doWork(long sleepTime) {
        try {
            log.info("Starting work");
            Thread.sleep(sleepTime);
            log.info("Finishing work");
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            throw new RuntimeException(e);
        }
    }
}
{{</highlight>}}

Annotation alone will not be enough, and it's not going to work by itself. We have to hack something
extra which will allow us to detect those methods and somehow execute extra code around them. Well,
spring does a lot of things like that. Have you ever wondered how transactional annotation works?
Luckily spring provides abstractions that simplify a lot.

Let's do baby steps and first of all find methods in which we are interested in:

{{<highlight java>}}
private boolean hasAnyMeasuredMethod(Object bean) {
    return Stream
            .of(ReflectionUtils.getAllDeclaredMethods(bean.getClass()))
            .anyMatch(method -> AnnotationUtils.getAnnotation(method, Measured.class) != null);
}
{{</highlight>}}

From this, we'll be able to tell if we should even consider this class as a candidate on which we'd
like to do any processing.

Now getting to a bit harder part - measurements itself. If we'd have to implement it by ourselves
we'd probably just do something like this:

{{<highlight java>}}
public void doWork(long sleepTime) {
    StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();
    stopWatch.start();
    try {
        // do things
    } finally {
        stopWatch.stop();
        log.info("Execution took {}", stopWatch.getLastTaskTimeMillis());
    }
}
{{</highlight>}}

But the problem is that an instance of the object is already created. So we need to do something
more complicated and somehow wrap the existing method with time measurements. We are already using
spring and it comes with nice abstractions that allow us to do exactly that (no need to struggle
with cglib ;)). Using `ProxyFactory` we can pretty easily introduce some AOP programming and do
exactly what we need. Let’s write the implementation of `MethodInvocationInterceptor`:

{{<highlight java>}}
private static class MeasuringMethodInterceptor implements MethodInterceptor {
    @Override
    public Object invoke(MethodInvocation invocation) throws Throwable {
        final Method method = invocation.getMethod();
        final Measured annotation = AnnotationUtils.getAnnotation(method, Measured.class);
        return annotation == null
                ? invocation.proceed()
                : proceedMeasured(invocation, annotation.value());
    }

    private Object proceedMeasured(MethodInvocation invocation, String loggerName) throws Throwable {
        final Logger logger = LoggerFactory.getLogger(loggerName);
        final StopWatch stopWatch = new StopWatch();
        stopWatch.start();

        try {
            return invocation.proceed();
        } finally {
            stopWatch.stop();
            logger.warn(
                    "Execution of {} took {} ms",
                    resolveLogMethod(invocation), stopWatch.getTotalTimeMillis());
        }
    }

    private String resolveLogMethod(MethodInvocation invocation) {
        return invocation.getMethod().getDeclaringClass().getCanonicalName() + "#" + invocation.getMethod().getName();
    }
}
{{</highlight>}}

A couple of things is happening in here so let's start from the beginning. Method interceptor is an
Advice (`org.aopalliance.aop.Advice`) which is the base interface for all aspect-oriented things in
spring. With `MethodInterceptor` we can easily write something that will allow us to intercept
method invocation, modify the result or maybe do something extra around the method which is called.

Firstly we examine if the method has annotation `@Measured` on it. If not just call it and
forget about the whole thing. If not let's do exactly what we would have done if writing it
manually.

Now, all we have to do is take advantage of `ProxyFactory` available in spring and just wrap our
class in a proxy and we are good to go.

{{<highlight java>}}
@Component
class MeasuringBeanPostProcessor implements BeanPostProcessor {
    @Override
    public Object postProcessAfterInitialization(Object bean, String beanName) throws BeansException {
        if (hasAnyMeasuredMethod(bean)) {
            return measuredProxy(bean);
        }

        return bean;
    }

    private Object measuredProxy(Object bean) {
        ProxyFactory proxyFactory = new ProxyFactory(bean);
        proxyFactory.addAdvice(new MeasuringMethodInterceptor());
        return proxyFactory.getProxy();
    }

    private boolean hasAnyMeasuredMethod(Object bean) {
        return Stream
                .of(ReflectionUtils.getAllDeclaredMethods(bean.getClass()))
                .anyMatch(method -> AnnotationUtils.getAnnotation(method, Measured.class) != null);
    }
}
{{</highlight>}}

so you don’t really need to write one by yourself.

Let’s quickly test (writing unit test for it is out of the scope of this post ;)) our solution and
see how it’s working:

{{<highlight java>}}
@SpringBootApplication
class BeanpostprocessorApplication {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        final ConfigurableApplicationContext ctx = SpringApplication.run(BeanpostprocessorApplication.class, args);
        final SampleService bean = ctx.getBean(SampleService.class);

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            bean.doWork(TimeUnit.SECONDS.toMillis(1000));
        }
    }
}
{{</highlight>}}

And the logs from the execution:

Wasn’t so hard after all right? As you can see hacking something like that is actually pretty easy
thing to do.

I’m not responsible for any damage you’ll do on your production servers using this naive
implementation :) Note the overhead of extra abstraction.

Interesting bean post processors

To give you some ideas what you can achieve with this simple hook let’s take a look at a couple out
of the box post processors that are registered by default:

* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/v5.1.4.RELEASE/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/support/ApplicationContextAwareProcessor.java#L61[org.springframework.context.support.ApplicationContextAwareProcessor] - simple hook that will inject `ApplicationContext` instance into beans.
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/v5.1.4.RELEASE/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/context/support/ApplicationObjectSupport.java#L49[org.springframework.context.support.ApplicationListenerDetector] - register beans as `ApplicationListener` (`org.springframework.context.ApplicationListener`).
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/v5.1.4.RELEASE/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/AsyncAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.java#L65[org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.AsyncAnnotationBeanPostProcessor] - creates proxy around `@Async` methods so they get executed via `ExecutorService`.
* https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/v5.1.4.RELEASE/spring-context/src/main/java/org/springframework/scheduling/annotation/ScheduledAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.java#L103[org.springframework.scheduling.annotation.ScheduledAnnotationBeanPostProcessor] - hook which recognises `@Scheduled` methods of the bean when `@EnableScheduling` is applied.

[.lead]
Summary

Next time you'd like to customize your bean after it's been created and you are using spring
framework in your application you'll know that there is a hook designed to do exactly that. As you
can see achieving things like measuring the execution time of particular methods is not so
complicated (at least naive implementation of it). Spring offers a lot of convenient abstractions
that allow to hook up into its internals and `BeanPostProcessor` is just one of them.
