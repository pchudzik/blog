Mocking library is an important tool in every developer toolbox. Sometimes you want to do things
that at first glance look a bit more complex than returning number 42 from some method. Let’s see
what stubbing techniques are available in Mockito out of the box and what they offer.

Word of warning

When you have to use some of the answers from below it either means that you are working with some
legacy system and need to make things testable so you can proceed with refactoring. Or it means that
you’ve just produced some shitty design and should think it over. I only hope that what you are
facing is legacy system.

RETURNS_DEFAULTS

https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/3.0.0/org/mockito/Mockito.html#RETURNS_DEFAULTS

We should start with default Mockito behavior which is `RETURNS_DEFAULTS` You are probably already
familiar with it because that’s how Mockito works out of the box.

{{<highlight java>}}
@Test
public void returns_defaults() {
	//given
	class SomeObject {
		public int getInt() {
			return 100;
		}

		public boolean getBoolean() {
			return true;
		}

		public String getString() {
			return "abc";
		}

		public List<String> getList() {
			return null;
		}
	}
	final SomeObject object = Mockito.mock(SomeObject.class);

	assertThat(object.getInt(), is(0));
	assertThat(object.getBoolean(), is(false));
	assertThat(object.getString(), nullValue());
	assertThat(object.getList().size(), is(0));
}
{{</highlight>}}

What you might’ve missed is what values will be returned for primitives (and their boxed values). It looks following:
{{<highlight text>}}
Boolean                                   -> false
Character                                 -> \u0000
Byte, Short, Integer, Long, Float, Double -> 0
{{</highlight>}}

There is one more default behavior that’s is often overlooked. This strategy will try and return
empty collection for of appropriate type if you’ll ask for it. It’ll return empty List or Set or
even a Map and Optional in java8 -

CALLS_REAL_METHODS

https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/3.0.0/org/mockito/Mockito.html#CALLS_REAL_METHODS

Strategy used by default when you create a spy of an object (or partial mock). It tries to create an
instance of the object and forward all calls to real methods in this object recording all
interactions and allows to partially stub object behavior.

{{<highlight java>}}
@Test
public void calls_real_methods() {
	//given
	class Dragon {
		public String burn() {
			return "fire";
		}

		public int heat() {
			return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
		}
	}
	final Dragon dragonSpy = Mockito.mock(Dragon.class, Mockito.CALLS_REAL_METHODS);

	//expect
	assertThat(dragonSpy.burn(), equalTo("fire"));
	assertThat(dragonSpy.heat(), equalTo(Integer.MAX_VALUE));

	//when
	Mockito.when(dragonSpy.burn()).thenReturn("ice");
	Mockito.when(dragonSpy.heat()).thenReturn(Integer.MIN_VALUE);

	//then
	assertThat(dragonSpy.burn(), is("ice"));
	assertThat(dragonSpy.heat(), is(Integer.MIN_VALUE));
}
{{</highlight>}}

RETURNS_SMALL_NULLS

https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/3.0.0/org/mockito/Mockito.html#RETURNS_SMART_NULLS

The answer that will throw nice NullPointer like exception that will allow you to find places in
code that are using mocks and fix them. I honestly have never used it but maybe in some exotic
cases, it might be useful.

{{<highlight java>}}
@Test
public void returns_smart_nulls() {
	//given
	class SomeObject {
		BigDecimal someValue() {
			return BigDecimal.ZERO;
		}
	}
	final SomeObject object = Mockito.mock(SomeObject.class, Mockito.RETURNS_SMART_NULLS);

	//when
	catchException(object.someValue()).abs();

	//then
	assertThat(caughtException(), isA(SmartNullPointerException.class));
}
{{</highlight>}}

In case of NPE exception you’ll get following stack trace message:

{{<highlight text>}}
You have a NullPointerException here:
-> at com.pchudzik.blog.example.stubbing.MockitoStubbing.returns_smart_nulls(MockitoStubbing.java:83)
because this method call was *not* stubbed correctly:
-> at com.pchudzik.blog.example.stubbing.MockitoStubbing.returns_smart_nulls(MockitoStubbing.java:83)
someObject.someValue();

org.mockito.exceptions.verification.SmartNullPointerException:

someObject.someValue();

RETURNS_SELF

https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/3.0.0/org/mockito/Mockito.html#RETURNS_SELF

If you need to stub builder object here’s the strategy that will work out of the box providing very
convenient behavior to be used with builders.

{{<highlight java>}}
@Test
public void returns_self() {
	//given
	class Builder {
		Builder setA() {
			return this;
		}

		Builder setB() {
			return this;
		}

		Builder setC() {
			return this;
		}

		String build() {
			return "done";
		}
	}
	final Builder builder = Mockito.mock(Builder.class, Mockito.RETURNS_SELF);
	Mockito.when(builder.build()).thenReturn("mock");

	//when
	final String result = builder
			.setA()
			.setB()
			.setC()
			.build();

	//then
	assertThat(result, is("mock"));
}
{{</highlight>}}

[.lead]
RETURNS_MOCKS

https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/3.0.0/org/mockito/Mockito.html#RETURNS_MOCKS

An interesting answer that for every call will create a new mock instance. Might be useful if you
have long invocation chains in your code but you don’t care about them and all you need is a passing
test.

{{<highlight java>}}
@Test
public void returns_mocks() {
	class Child { }
	class Parent {
		Child getChild() {
			return null;
		}
	}
	final Parent parent = Mockito.mock(Parent.class, Mockito.RETURNS_MOCKS);

	//when
	Child child1 = parent.getChild();
	Child child2 = parent.getChild();
	Child child3 = parent.getChild();

	//then
	assertThat(child1, not(is(child2)));
	assertThat(child1, not(is(child3)));
	assertThat(child2, not(is(child3)));
}
{{</highlight>}}

[.lead]
RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS

https://static.javadoc.io/org.mockito/mockito-core/3.0.0/org/mockito/Mockito.html#RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS

Most interesting/dangerous one. If you need to use it, it probably means that you are doing
something very wrong and it’s time to step back and think it over… It’s very similar to
`RETURNS_MOCKS` but instead of returning new object every time you call it keeps the reference to it
allowing you to create deep stub chains or verifications.

{{<highlight java>}}
@Test
public void returns_deep_stubs() {
	//given
	class Spell {
		String doMagic() {
			return "poof";
		}
	}

	class Wand {
		private Spell spell;
		Spell getSpell() {
			return spell;
		}
	}

	class Fairy {
		private Wand wand;
		Wand getWand() {
			return wand;
		}
	}

	final Fairy deadFairy = Mockito.mock(Fairy.class, Mockito.RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS);

	//when
	Mockito.when(deadFairy.getWand().getSpell().doMagic()).thenReturn("Fairy is dead");

	//then
	assertThat(deadFairy.getWand().getSpell().doMagic(), is("Fairy is dead"));
}
{{</highlight>}}


I’ve been using Mockito for a couple of years now and I’ve only used `RETURNS_SELF` and seen other
people using `RETURNS_DEEP_STUBS` but I think it’s good to know that other options can be used and
what’s the default behavior of the widely used framework.
