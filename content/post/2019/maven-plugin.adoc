In the past, I’ve been doing various things with maven. Some of them were standard, some were more
complicated and a couple of them were complex. For those complex solutions, I felt like I needed a
plugin but I’ve never had enough time to write it properly. In this post, I’m going to explore the
basics of writing maven plugin.

<!--more-->

When developing custom build solutions/workarounds I’ve never had a chance to investigate how to
write proper maven plugin. Because of that my way to go solution was to use Gradle and if not
possible to write a Groovy script that will do exactly what I need and execute it with
groovy-maven-plugin using https://groovy.github.io/gmaven/groovy-maven-plugin/execute.html[execute
goal]. This approach is working, it's easy and fast to develop, but usually, it feels like a
workaround...

In maven, one can develop plugins which extend the behavior of particular lifecycle phases and I’ve
never written one... I’ve decided it’s about time to give it a try and write plugin on my own. In
this post, we’ll do just the basics so you can bootstrap your own plugin really quick, as it turns
out doing more advanced things is just a matter of your java code, not maven infrastructure.

First of all, we have to declare that the packing of the project will be maven-plugin like this:

{{<highlight xml>}}
<packaging>maven-plugin</packaging>
{{</highlight>}}

Let’s start with dependencies that are required and simplify your life:

{{<highlight xml>}}
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-plugin-api</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.1</version>
</dependency>
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugin-tools</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-plugin-annotations</artifactId>
    <version>3.4</version>
    <scope>provided</scope>
</dependency>
{{</highlight>}}

Those will provide basic API classes and interfaces along with annotations required for plugin
development. Next is the plugin that generates help goal and documentation from created
https://maven.apache.org/general.html#What_is_a_Mojo[Mojo]:

{{<highlight xml>}}
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-plugin-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>3.6.0</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <id>default-descriptor</id>
            <phase>process-classes</phase>
        </execution>
        <execution>
            <id>help-goal</id>
            <goals>
                <goal>helpmojo</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
</plugin>
{{</highlight>}}

With those configured all is left is to actually write plugin logic:

{{<highlight java>}}
@Mojo(name = "greeting", defaultPhase = LifecyclePhase.INITIALIZE)
public class SimplestPlugin extends AbstractMojo {
    @Parameter(required = true)
    private String name;

    @Override
    public void execute() throws MojoExecutionException, MojoFailureException {
        getLog().info("Hello " + name);
    }
}
{{</highlight>}}

The plugin does nothing special and it’s up to you to add extra logic to it. @Mojo allows to
basically declare a goal. You can easily pass parameters from pom.xml to the plugin using
http://maven.apache.org/guides/plugin/guide-java-plugin-development.html#Parameters[@Parameter]
annotation. The field name will be parameter name (or you can use alias property) and inside execute
method there is a place for your logic.

Once we’ve finally deployed (or installed in this case ;)) the plugin we can finally use this plugin
we have to declare it in build/plugins section as follows:

{{<highlight xml>}}
<plugin>
    <groupId>com.pchudzik.blog.example</groupId>
    <artifactId>sample-maven-plugin</artifactId>
    <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <executions>
        <execution>
            <goals>
                <goal>greeting</goal>
            </goals>
        </execution>
    </executions>
    <configuration>
        <name>Pawel</name>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
{{</highlight>}}

And we can easily verify if it’s executed:

{{<highlight text>}}

There is a couple of links that you should know of, you'll find a lot of valuable information
there:

* http://maven.apache.org/developers/mojo-api-specification.html
* http://maven.apache.org/guides/plugin/guide-java-plugin-development.html
* http://maven.apache.org/guides/plugin/guide-java-report-plugin-development.html
* http://maven.apache.org/plugin-developers/common-bugs.html

That’s all you need to write the simplest plugin possible. I wanted to explore the basics before
jumping head into it. I wasn't sure what to expect from maven plugin API but it turns out writing
plugin on your own is not complicated nor cumbersome. In the future instead of the groovy script
I’ll probably go for a plugin based solution because you can properly test the logic and decouple
build logic from the project code itself.
