Version management in maven (especially in multi-module projects) was not pleasant and required
multiple build steps, some magic commands and maybe bash script here and there. With version 3.5.0
new cool feature has been added to maven. From https://maven.apache.org/maven-ci-friendly.html[this
version] you can easily customize your build number from build tools using simple properties like
`${revision}` `${sha1}` and `${changelist}`.

TL;DR

You can define and/or pass following properties ${revision} ${sha1} and ${changelist} and safely use
them in version tag of your project.

Prerequisites

Before you even start thinking about versioning you should consider using
https://semver.org[Semantic Versioning] as a base for your releases. If you are not, it should be
your conscious decision.

The problem

With previous maven versions, it’s always been painful to manage project version especially if you
had multiple modules in your project. In the past, my way to go solution was
https://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/[maven version plugin] with its
https://www.mojohaus.org/versions-maven-plugin/set-mojo.html[versions:set] goal which allowed to
bump project version. It is working but results in changes in many files and it always requires
googling or checking bash history in order to find the spell required to bump project version.

When working with maven and managing project version my first go to idea was to basically have
somewhere in your project bash script that removed `-SNAPSHOT` from the project version and then
bumped the last number by 1 and added `-SNAPSHOT` suffix again. Preferably using maven versions
plugin. This resulted in the quite complex build script and complicated release process which I’m
not even going to explain now since it’s outdated :)

The second idea was to allow a user to fill in version during build/deployment process (current date
or build number by default for example) and just set it using version plugin. This one is even more
complicated as it requires human interaction which leaves space for error…

The solution shipped with new maven

New properties have been added to maven (`${revision}` `${sha1}` and `${changelist}`) and you can
use them in version tag of your project. You can set it in project properties (properties tag), pass
it from the command line or even store them in external file `.mvn/maven.config`. With this, your
project version is set in a single place (in many multi-module projects all modules are released as
single version). It can be even decoupled from your pom file…

Samples

Let’s start with parent pom:
{{<highlight xml>}}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

  <groupId>com.pchudzik.blog.example</groupId>
  <artifactId>maven-revision</artifactId>
  <version>${revision}</version>

  <modules>
    <module>project1</module>
    <module>project2</module>
  </modules>

  <name>maven-revision</name>
  <packaging>pom</packaging>

  <properties>
    <revision>1.0.0-SNAPSHOT</revision>
    <project.build.sourceEncoding>UTF-8</project.build.sourceEncoding>
    <maven.compiler.source>1.8</maven.compiler.source>
    <maven.compiler.target>1.8</maven.compiler.target>
  </properties>

</project>
{{</highlight>}}

And two submodules. Project 1:
{{<highlight xml>}}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <parent>
        <artifactId>maven-revision</artifactId>
        <groupId>com.pchudzik.blog.example</groupId>
        <version>${revision}</version>
    </parent>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <artifactId>project1</artifactId>

    <name>project1</name>
</project>
{{</highlight>}}

And Project 2:
{{<highlight xml>}}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

<project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
    <parent>
        <artifactId>maven-revision</artifactId>
        <groupId>com.pchudzik.blog.example</groupId>
        <version>${revision}</version>
    </parent>
    <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>

    <artifactId>project2</artifactId>

    <name>project2</name>

    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>com.pchudzik.blog.example</groupId>
            <artifactId>project1</artifactId>
            <version>${revision}</version>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</project>
{{</highlight>}}

So after a clean package (or install or deploy) project version will be set to `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT` as
it is defined in parent pom’s properties. We can easily customize it using `mvn clean package
-Drevision=2.0.0`. That’s pretty handy when used with CI tools. If you want to decouple project
version from all you have to do is remove revision from properties and define it in
`mvn/maven.config` in the following way: `-Drevision=1.5.0-SNAPSHOT`
(https://github.com/blog-pchudzik-examples/blog-example-maven-revision/blob/version_in_file/.mvn/maven.config[the
file]) and that’s all. Now you can update the project version without changing a single thing in
your pom file.

As always source code for examples can be found on my
https://github.com/blog-pchudzik-examples/blog-example-maven-revision[GitHub], and a version with
decoupled maven version is on a
https://github.com/blog-pchudzik-examples/blog-example-maven-revision/tree/version_in_file[separate
branch]. You should also checkout https://maven.apache.org/maven-ci-friendly.html[official maven
announcement for the change].
