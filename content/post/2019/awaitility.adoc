If you are not working with multithreading programming and don’t have to test any asynchronous code
then this post will probably do you nothing good. But if you have ever struggled with testing some
logic running in multiple threads and you don’t know
https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility[Awaitility]. A small library helps testing asynchronous
code. If you've never heard of it then you should continue reading.

If the framework you are using is hiding all the multithreading complexity from you, and you never
have to work with threads or ExecutorService then you’ll probably will find no usage for
https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility[Awaitility]. Awaitility is a small library designed to help
you out with testing asynchronous code. It does only this one thing and does it well.

On Awaitility's GitHub you can read:

Testing asynchronous systems is hard. Not only does it require handling threads, timeouts and
concurrency issues, but the intent of the test code can be obscured by all these details. Awaitility
is a DSL that allows you to express expectations of an asynchronous system in a concise and easy to
read manner.

If you’ve ever tried to write tests for asynchronous code you know exactly what they mean on their website.

With Awaitility one can easily implement tests for asynchronous code. In order to keep it simple
let's write tests for a producer-consumer problem with simple queue in the middle. We have one
thread producing something pushing data on the queue and other thread consuming those messages as
they come. Now if we want to write tests for this kind of program we’ll have to write our own DSL to
do it or we’d have to introduce a lot of complexity into test logic to wait for test scenario to
finish. With Awaitility it’s much easier:

{{<highlight groovy>}}
def "consumes all messages if producer is fast"() {
    given:
    final numberOfMessages = 10
    final fastProducer = 10
    final slowConsumer = 100

    and:
    final coordinator = new Coordinator(messageRepository, numberOfMessages, smallQueue, fastProducer, slowConsumer)

    when:
    final consumer = coordinator.startConsumer()
    final producer = coordinator.startProducer()

    then:
    await()
            .atMost(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            .until(
                    { messageRepository.count() },
                    equalTo(numberOfMessages))

    cleanup:
    [consumer, producer, coordinator].each { it.close() }
}

def "consumes all messages if producer is slow"() {
    given:
    final numberOfMessages = 10
    final slowProducer = 100
    final fastConsumer = 10

    and:
    final coordinator = new Coordinator(messageRepository, numberOfMessages, smallQueue, slowProducer, fastConsumer)

    when:
    final consumer = coordinator.startConsumer()
    final producer = coordinator.startProducer()

    then:
    await()
            .atMost(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
            .until(
                    { messageRepository.count() },
                    equalTo(numberOfMessages))

    cleanup:
    [consumer, producer, coordinator].each { it.close() }
}

Besides this naive example like above, you can take a look into
https://github.com/awaitility/awaitility/wiki/Usage#usage-examples[other examples] available in the
official wiki page of the project.

As you see testing asynchronous code with Awaitility is much easier and doesn’t clog your test logic
with low-level checks required to verify system behaviour or even worse `Thread.sleep` calls just to
wait a bit until everything is finished. Next time when you’ll have to write tests that have to test
some async logic remember about this small and useful utility :)
