Some time ago I've started working on updating automated tests written in selenium with java. After
working a bit with it I've noticed that from time to time constructing XPath expression can get
ugly. We are writing our tests in pure java and "ugliness" usually comes from string concatenation
when some extra parameters must be taken into account. I've decided to
https://github.com/pchudzik/fluentxpath[write something] that might help a bit with building XPaths
without string concatenation.

tl;dr

I've created https://github.com/pchudzik/fluentxpath[fluentXPath] library which allows to build
XPath expression without concatenating strings and provides fluent syntax to construct XPaths.


[.lead]
No warranty of any kind

Note that does not offer anything but builder for XPaths. It doesn't check if your XPath is valid
it's nothing but syntactic sugar so you don't have to concatenate strings. If you are using groovy
or Kotlin or any other JVM language with string interpolation you should probably use interpolation
instead of fluentXPath. Except from a bit of suggar there is nothing extra that you wouldn't achieve
with simple string concatenation and unless your expression are complex you should be fine with
simple `"a" + "b"`.

Why?

Firstly I don't like to concatenate strings and for now, I'll have to use pure java for automated
tests. The second reason was to learn and understand better complex XPath expressions.

Examples

{{<highlight java>}}
String builderCommentsLink = xpathOf()
    .anyElement("div")
    .has(
            xpathFn().and(asList(
                    xpathFn().eq(xpathAttribute("data-test-article-id"), xpathValue("123")),
                    xpathFn().contains(
                        xpathFn().lowerCase(xpathAttribute("data-test-article-category")),
                        xpathValue("News")))))
    .descendantElement("span")
    .has(
            xpathFn().contains(
                    xpathAttribute("class"),
                    xpathValue("links")))
    .descendantElement("a")
    .has(
        xpathFn().contains(
            xpathFn().lowerCase(xpathFn().text()),
            xpathValue("comments")))
    .build();
{{</highlight>}}

You can write something more complex which allows to build XPaths more dynamically:

{{<highlight java>}}
Stream<String> newArticleIds = Stream.of("1","2","3","4");

private static List<XPathExpression> articleIdIn(Stream<String> newArticleIds) {
    return newArticleIds
        .map(singleArticleId -> xpathFn().eq(
                xpathAttribute("data-test-article-id"),
                xpathValue(singleArticleId)))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}

xpathOf()
    .anyElement("div")
    .has(
            xpathFn().and(asList(
                    xpathFn().or(articleIdIn(newArticleIds)),
                    xpathFn().contains(
                        xpathFn().lowerCase(xpathAttribute("data-test-article-category")),
                        xpathValue("News")))))
    .descendantElement("span")
    .has(
            xpathFn().contains(
                    xpathAttribute("class"),
                    xpathValue("links")))
    .descendantElement("a")
    .has(xpathFn().contains(
        xpathFn().lowerCase(xpathFn().text()),
        xpathValue("comments")))
    .build();
{{</highlight>}}

Of course many functions are still missing but you are free to define them on your own (or create
something  that you'll be able to use like aliases).

{{<highlight java>}}
private static class XPathCount implements XPathExpression {
    private final XPathExpression expression;

    private XPathCount(XPathExpression expression) {
        this.expression = expression;
    }

    @Override
    public String build() {
        return "count((" +
                expression.build() +
                "))";
    }
}

xpathFn().greaterThan(
        new XPathCount(xpathOf()
            .anyElement("a")
            .has(xpathFn().contains(
                xpathAttribute("class"),
                xpathValue("links")))),
        xpathValue(4))
    .build();
{{</highlight>}}

How to get it

Just add dependencies to pom.xml:

{{<highlight xml>}}
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.pchudzik</groupId>
  <artifactId>fluentxpath</artifactId>
  <version>1.0.0</version>
</dependency>
{{</highlight>}}

or to build.gradle:

{{<highlight gradle>}}
compile "com.pchudzik:fluentxpath:1.0.0"
{{</highlight>}}

To find out latest available version you check out
https://github.com/pchudzik/fluentxpath/blob/master/README.md#releases[readme file]. If you decide to give it
a try please let me know about any https://github.com/pchudzik/fluentxpath/issues/new[bugs] I’ve
missed. Don’t hesitate to https://github.com/pchudzik/fluentxpath/issues/new[request new features]
there is a good chance that I’ll implement them.
