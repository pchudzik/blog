In this post, I’d like to show you how I’ve started with writing this blog.
How the process evolved during 3 years of writing.
How I’ve finally managed to set up everything in a way that works for me now.
If you don’t blog yet this might help you out with technical details on how you can start easily.
If you already have a blog maybe you’ll be able to pick up some ideas.

Engine

[.center-image]
image::hugo.png[Hugo logo]

I use a static site generator - https://gohugo.io[Hugo] and I’m happy with it.
There is a lot of ready to use themes available in the https://themes.gohugo.io[themes section] so you should be able to pick something up and just start.
People build pretty https://gohugo.io/showcase/[impressive sites] with Hugo so you should be good on the functionalities side.

I’ve started writing my posts in plain markdown text.
Later I’ve switched to asciidoc as it offers more styling options and I like it better.
You should start with markdown as it’s much simpler and supported out of the box.
Later if you’ll be lacking features/styling you can check out other document formats that might work better for you.

There is a lot of themes available but nothing is perfect and sooner or later you’ll want to customize something.
With Hugo, it’s really simple just copy files you want to modify and change whatever you like.
There is no complicated process around it, no pull requests unless you want to (and you should if it’s something worth sharing).
It is really simple and allows you to tweak minor details of the theme you’ve selected without much effort.

Right now I have around 140 pages and building it from scratch takes around 20 seconds on the 2015 MacBook.
Luckily incremental build is much faster and the page is usually already refreshing when I ctrl+tab to it when working on a post.
A cold start could’ve been faster but I accept it as I don’t have to install any additional dependencies but docker.

I’ve written simple scripts to serve a working copy of it on the localhost.
{{<highlight bash>}}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

docker run -it --rm \
  -v $PWD:/src \
  -v $PWD/site:/site \
  -e "HUGO_ENV=dev" \
  --entrypoint hugo-official \
  -p 1313:1313 \
  klakegg/hugo:0.64.1-asciidoctor \
  server --buildDrafts --buildFuture --buildExpired --bind 0.0.0.0 --destination /site
{{</highlight>}}

Running the whole thing from docker is really convenient as you don’t have to install anything to write a post.
Having a whole engine available in docker creates automation possibilities - continuous deployment.

Writing

[.center-image]
image::pen.jpeg[]

I start with writing posts in apple’s notes app (previous Evernote and other note-taking services).
I write the first version in notes because I can access it from a tablet and phone.
I can easily rework it, attach files, write down ideas, etc.
I always struggle to sit down and actually write something and having it easily accessible on any device helps.

I used to have the whole folder of unfinished blog posts in the note-taking application.
I dropped this approach and migrated ideas to Trello where I can easily track things I’d like to write about and things I’ve decided to kill.
Again having it available everywhere helps.
If it’s post idea - one minute it’s there and next, I don’t remember what I wanted to fetch from the kitchen.
It’s important to write ideas as they are very volatile and tend to be forgotten.

When working on a post I first do a plan of what I need to do before I can actually write something.
I’ve got two modes of writing.
When I’m familiar with the topic I usually start with the content as this is most troublesome for me and then prepare samples of what I want to show later once I have a narration.

When I’m exploring something I try to start from the project where I play around with the idea and see if it’s worth writing about.
When I do it the other way around and start from content then I often have to rework big parts of the post.
I’ve dropped a couple of posts as it turned out something is too trivial or I don’t feel comfortable writing about it.

Once I got post content, code samples, schemas, images ready I copy-paste it to asciidoc file.
Splitting sentences one per line to make them shorter, rephrase them and remove what doesn’t make sense.
Then I use https://app.grammarly.com[Grammarly] to check for typos and whatever it’s checking in the free version.
Finally, after crunching (read it from time to time and let it sit in) on it for some time I publish it.

Hosting

For a very long time, I’ve been paying for hosting a couple of euros a year.
Most of the time I’ve been happy with it but then some things stopped working.
Hosting provider disabled my deployment pipeline by blacklisting some AWS IPs on FTP server - no more deployments from Travis.
Then they’ve messed some Apache/Nginx configuration to improve performance/disable robots from scanning posts and as result disabled RSS downloading without browser like headers.
After this, I’ve started looking for alternatives.

For some time I’ve been thinking about using S3 for hosting and I was mentally ready to do the migration when I’ve stumbled upon https://netlify.com/[netlify].
Netlify allows to host static sites for free (with some transfer limits of course) and offers more possibilities like CDN, building single-page applications, and even some handlers for HTML forms.
They have an API and CLI tool. It’s free for me as I don’t come close to the bandwidth limits.


[.lead]
Deployment

[.center-image]
image::pipeline.jpg[Pipeline]

I used to use Travis but now actions are available on GitHub.
I’ve implemented deployment on GitHub when I’ve switched hosting provider.
I wanted to check out how it works and I had to redo deployment anyway.
I’ve configured pipeline which runs after every commit on master.
It builds this site using Hugo’s official Docker image and publishes produced files to netlify.

The whole thing is just https://github.com/pchudzik/blog.pchudzik.com/blob/1d3b275cc44c9f6ab191af71f0c44e5d98ac3ac1/.github/workflows/netlify.yml[yaml file] that describes the build:
{{<highlight yaml>}}
name: deploy

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - master

jobs:
  build:
    name: Build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v1
      - name: Make directories
        run: |
          mkdir -p themes
          mkdir -p site
      - name: Download theme
        run: (cd themes && git clone https://github.com/pdevty/material-design.git)
      - name: Deploy
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
        run: ./deploy.sh
{{</highlight>}}

and https://github.com/pchudzik/blog.pchudzik.com/blob/1d3b275cc44c9f6ab191af71f0c44e5d98ac3ac1/deploy.sh[deploy.sh] file:

{{<highlight bash>}}
#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -e

if [ -f credentials.sh ]; then
  . ./credentials.sh
fi

docker run --rm \
  -v $PWD:/src \
  -v $PWD/site:/site \
  -e "HUGO_ENV=production" \
  --entrypoint hugo-official \
  klakegg/hugo:0.64.1-asciidoctor --minify -d /site

sudo chmod -R 777 site

docker run --rm \
  -e NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN="$NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN" \
  -e NETLIFY_SITE_ID="$NETLIFY_SITE_ID" \
  -v $PWD/site:/project \
  williamjackson/netlify-cli:2.32.0 deploy --prod --dir=/project
{{</highlight>}}

I try to avoid fixing build pipeline on predefined actions as those things change.
I don’t want to do big vendor lock with my process and have the possibility to run the deployment even from my local machine.
Also, I want to spend as less time as possible on maintaining this part.
Keeping things simple keeps my options open.

[.lead]
Testing

[.center-image]
image::testing.jpg[I don't always test my code, but when I do I do it on production]
From time to time after upgrading Hugo version or tweaking theme details I notice some bugs appearing (it’s on me as I don’t read release notes too often).
I‘m thinking about writing simple tests to verify if everything works fine after deployment (a couple of simple checks like is RSS link there and content of it generated properly, etc).
For now, it’s suspended unless I’ll be checking out a new testing approach of framework.
Otherwise, it’s not worth the effort because I or someone else will notice it sooner or later ;)

[.lead]
Summary

This process works for me and all technical details are the easiest and less significant part of the process.
I’ve been tweaking them for 3 years now to make delivering this blog as painless as possible.
The only part that still hurts is producing topics I want to write about.
I started really simple with Hugo, ready to use template, insecure FTP account, and a couple of post ideas.
With time it evolved and now I’m happy about all but writing process and that’s something I want to improve in the future.
