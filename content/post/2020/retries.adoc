The simplest possible strategy that can help with communication issues is retrying to execute the request again.
Maybe it was just a network glitch and it will work just fine when you try to call it again.
Introducing retries is a relatively simple step that can improve the stability of your service.
But before adding retries check if you'll not be waiting for 2 minutes for establishing the connection...

Connection settings

So you've added feign to your project and you think doing `Feign.builder().target(Service.class, "http://example.com")` will do the trick?
I'm afraid you might be surprised here.
https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign/blob/10.8/core/src/main/java/feign/Request.java#L295[Feign defaults] are to wait 10 seconds to establish a connection and 60 seconds to read the data.
Are you willing to wait for so long or maybe even a bit longer if you decide to try it https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign/blob/10.8/core/src/main/java/feign/Retryer.java#L40[5 times]?

Going with defaults might be the fastest way to start but might cause you some unexpected issues along the way.
It doesn't matter what http client you prefer you must always review http settings and be aware what you are accepting as default value.

Retries

When picking the number of times to retry you should think first about the service you are implementing right now.
If your response is expected to arrive within 200ms you can retry to 5 times to a service that responds in 100ms.
People might start retrying you.
In the worst-case scenario, this might lead to https://blog.pchudzik.com/201912/microservices-are-hard/[cascade failure of the system].
Going with defaults on your configuration might not be the most reasonable option.
The number of retries should depend on your service SLAs and the service you are calling response times.

If in case of a failure you should not execute requests one after another.
Calling continuously might not give enough time for target service to recover.
Before each retry you should add some delays between calls.

Retries and http settings with Feign

Connection settings are easy to configure in feign.
Retries are also pretty straight forward.

{{<highlight java "linenos=table">}}
@Test
public void feign_retries_sample() {
    WireMockScenario
        .of(get(urlMatching("/hello")), wireMockRule)
        .willRespondWith(
            aResponse().withFault(Fault.CONNECTION_RESET_BY_PEER),
            aResponse().withStatus(503).withBody("service unavailable"),
            OK_RESPONSE);

    HelloWorld target = Feign.builder()
            .options(new Request.Options(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS, 2, TimeUnit.SECONDS, true))
            .retryer(new Retryer.Default(50, 200, 3))
            .contract(new JAXRSContract())
            .logger(new Slf4jLogger())
            .logLevel(Logger.Level.BASIC)
            .decoder(new GsonDecoder())
            .encoder(new GsonEncoder())
            .errorDecoder(new ErrorDecoder.Default() {
                @Override
                public Exception decode(String methodKey, Response response) {
                    if (response.status() == 503) {
                        return new RetryableException(
                            response.status(), "Received " + response.status() + " from server",
                            response.request().httpMethod(), null, response.request());
                    }

                    return super.decode(methodKey, response);
                }
            })
            .target(HelloWorld.class, "http://localhost:8080");

    String value = target.sayHello().getMessage();

    assertThat(value, equalTo("hello world"));
}

* Line 3-8 wire mock will respond in order with: connection error, 503 error and finally with valid response.
* Line 11 configure feign default settings (_override https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign/blob/10.8/core/src/main/java/feign/Request.java#L295[default configuration]_ of 10 seconds for connection and 60 seconds for read timeouts)
  If you want you can play around with this and comment this line to see if you'll be patient enough for the test to pass...
* Line 12 configure retry to run 3 times waiting 50 ms between calls and not exceeding 200ms on the request.
* Line 18-27 extend default error decoder to retry on 503 errors.
  _Be aware that retry on anything other than IOException is risky and should be considered carefully._
  It might make things worse not better.
  _Feign will retry on IOExceptions by default._
  If you want to retry on anything else you should implement ErrorDecoder and return RetryableException if you want to retry.

In order for all of this to work you'll need following dependencies:

{{<highlight gradle>}}
compile "io.github.openfeign:feign-core:$feignVersion"
compile "io.github.openfeign:feign-jaxrs2:$feignVersion"
compile "io.github.openfeign:feign-gson:$feignVersion"
compile "io.github.openfeign:feign-slf4j:$feignVersion" // Optional if you want to add logging line 15, 16
{{</highlight>}}

Feign offers basics capabilities out of the box which are good enough if you don't need anything more sophisticated.
In case you need more check out https://github.com/OpenFeign/feign#integrations[Feign integrations] maybe what you are looking for is already available.
In general, I enjoy working with Feign but I don't like that it doesn't force you to think about failures.
When it fails it fails with RuntimeException which you usually don't bother to catch (especially when they are thrown from external libraries).
It's easy to lose yourself in writing code and thinking about happy path and what comes next.
You need to be extra cautious when writing and reviewing code which uses Feign because it's in a human nature to forget.

Retries with resilience4j and http requests with okhttp and retrofit

To have comparison with Feign let's configure similar scenario with custom http settings and retries with resilience4j, retrofit and okhttp:

{{<highlight java "linenos=table">}}
@Test
public void resilience4j_retries_sample() throws Throwable {
    WireMockScenario
        .of(get(urlMatching("/hello")), wireMockRule)
        .willRespondWith(
            aResponse().withFault(Fault.CONNECTION_RESET_BY_PEER),
            aResponse().withStatus(503).withBody("Error"),
            OK_RESPONSE);

    HelloWorld target = new Retrofit.Builder()
            .client(new OkHttpClient.Builder()
                    .connectTimeout(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                    .readTimeout(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                    .callTimeout(2, TimeUnit.SECONDS)
                    .addInterceptor(new HttpLoggingInterceptor().setLevel(HttpLoggingInterceptor.Level.BASIC))
                    .build())
            .baseUrl("http://localhost:8080/")
            .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
            .build()
            .create(HelloWorld.class);

    RetryRegistry simpleRetryRegistry = RetryRegistry.of(RetryConfig.<Response<Hello>>custom()
            .intervalFunction(IntervalFunction.ofExponentialBackoff(50, 1.5))
            .maxAttempts(3)
            .retryOnException(ex -> {
                System.out.println(ex.getMessage());
                return true;
            })
            .retryOnResult(response -> response.code() == 503)
            .build());

    Optional<String> value = Optional
            .ofNullable(simpleRetryRegistry
                    .retry("hello world")
                    .executeCallable(() -> target.sayHello().execute())
                    .body())
            .map(Hello::getMessage);

    assertThat(value.orElse("FAIL"), equalTo("hello world"));
}

* Line 3-8 again wiremock configuration to respond with connection reset, 503 error, and valid response in that order.
* Line 11-14 setup http connection settings overriding https://github.com/square/okhttp/blob/okhttp_3.14.x/okhttp/src/main/java/okhttp3/OkHttpClient.java#L468[defaults of 10 seconds].
* Line 23,24 configure a delay for retries and how many times attempt.

* Line 25-27 retry on any exception (just to make it simple)
* Line 29 retry on 503 errors
  _Be aware that retry on anything other than IOException is risky and should be considered carefully._

I don't have a lot of experience with resilience4j nor retrofit.
What I like at first glance is that it forces you to think about failures but it comes with a price - you have to use retrofit annotations.
Resilience4j is not only bound to http calls you can retry anything with it which offers a lot of flexibility and much more than simple retries.

Summary

If you are facing some kind of a cascading failure or have some weird dependencies between services retrying requests can make things worse.
Retries are the simples solution but they are like a double-edged sword and you can cut yourself with it.
Try to think about what will happen in the worst-case scenario and what you should do to make the situation better not worse.
