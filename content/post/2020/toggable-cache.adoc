Sometimes it’s good to have an option to try something out on the live environment.
Checking things against production like traffic is the most reliable way to gather real-life metrics.
In this post, I’m going to try and set up spring cache with a toggle.
It’ll be possible to turn it off and on during application runtime possibly using external toggle service.

<!--more-->

Some time ago we've migrated cache provider from Ehcache to Redis.
In order to do it, we’ve prepared json serializers for some objects or simply removed caches that we thought were not necessary, in a couple of cases, it turned out they were.
In other, it turned out that it works faster without caching...
When we've been in the middle of the process an option to enable/disable cache (or simply fallback to Ehcache) in the runtime might've come handy.
Unfortunately, I didn't think about it then :(
This is pretty generic problem so I’ve decided to check how hard it can be to mix up some toggles with spring cache abstraction.

Idea is really simple just write a custom cache manager which will be able to decide if the cache is disabled or not based on toggle value.
Like this:

{{<highlight java>}}
class ToggleAwareCacheManager implements CacheManager {
    private static final Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(ToggleAwareCacheManager.class);

    private final ToggleProvider toggleProvider;
    private final CacheManager wrapped;
    private final CacheManager noOpCacheManager;

    ToggleAwareCacheManager(ToggleProvider toggleProvider, CacheManager wrapped) {
        this.noOpCacheManager = new NoOpCacheManager();
        this.toggleProvider = toggleProvider;
        this.wrapped = wrapped;
    }

    @Override
    public Cache getCache(String s) {
        if (toggleProvider.isCacheDisabled(s)) {
            return noOpCacheManager.getCache(s);
        }

        return wrapped.getCache(s);
    }

    @Override
    public Collection<String> getCacheNames() {
        return Stream
                .concat(noOpCacheManager.getCacheNames().stream(), wrapped.getCacheNames().stream())
                .collect(Collectors.toSet());
    }
}

Nothing complex here - if cache is disabled return no cache, if it's enabled delegate to redis cache.
Only thing worth noticing is the way cache names are build from both providers.
Spring context configuration:

{{<highlight java>}}
@Configuration
public class Config {
    @Value("${cache.redis.host}")
    private String host;

    @Value("${cache.redis.port}")
    private int port;

    @Bean
    public ToggleProvider toggleProvider() {
        return new ToggleProvider();
    }

    @Bean("cacheManager")
    public CacheManager cacheManager() {
        return new ToggleAwareCacheManager(
                toggleProvider(),
                RedisCacheManager.create(lettuceConnectionFactory()));
    }

    @Bean
    LettuceConnectionFactory lettuceConnectionFactory() {
        return new LettuceConnectionFactory(host, port);
    }
}

This is just proof of concept and not production ready solution so the main function which will show if it’s working is enough ;)

{{<highlight java>}}
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ConfigurableApplicationContext ctx = SpringApplication.run(ToggableCacheApplication.class, args);
    ToggleProvider toggle = ctx.getBean(ToggleProvider.class);
    CachedService service = ctx.getBean(CachedService.class);

    boolean isCacheEnabled = false;
    toggle.disableCache(Caches.FIRST);

    for (int runs = 0; runs < 5; runs++) {
        Stream
                .of(1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
                .forEach(i -> measure(() -> service.getValue(i)));

        isCacheEnabled = !isCacheEnabled;
        toggle.toggleCache(Caches.FIRST, isCacheEnabled);
    }
}

private static void measure(Runnable action) {
    long start = System.currentTimeMillis();
    try {
        action.run();
    } finally {
        long end = System.currentTimeMillis();
        log.info("Loading value took {}ms", (end - start));
    }
}

* 2-12 - Cache is disabled is value is calculated on demand.
* 13-25 - Enabling cache. Each value is calculated as it was previously disabled.
* 26-36 - Disabling cache. Although values are cached each item is calculated from scratch as cache is disabled.
* 37-42 - Enabling cache. Values are loaded from previously populated cache.
* 43-53 - Disabling cache. Again calculating values from scratch.

As you see implementing that wasn’t so complicated.
All you need to remember is that checking toggles can also be costly especially when toggles are served by separate service.
In those cases, you should introduce some client-side caching to avoid hitting external service, every time cache is accessed (eg. inside `ToggleProvider`) .
