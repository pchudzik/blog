The story is really simple. I wanted to accept my class as rest controller method param. I decided
that I don't want to convert a simple string to object every time and it would be faster if I do the
conversion in the single place. After a quick research I've found
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/core/convert/converter/Converter.html[Converter]
interface which looked like perfect for the job. After some digging and investigation it turns out
that there is a lot of automagic in the Spring conversion service.

<!--more-->

Let's start from the beginning and the controller I want to have:

{{<highlight java>}}
@WebMvcTest(controllers = Controller.class)
@RunWith(SpringRunner.class)
public class ControllerTest {
  @Autowired
  private MockMvc mockMvc;

  @Test
  public void should_parse_id_from_plain_string() throws Exception {
    //given
    final String emptyId = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000";

    //when
    mockMvc.perform(MockMvcRequestBuilders.get("/find-id/" + emptyId))

        //then
        .andExpect(status().isOk())
        .andExpect(jsonPath("$.id", equalTo(emptyId)));
  }
}
{{</highlight>}}

In order to make this test pass I need the controller:

{{<highlight java>}}
@RestController
class Controller {
  @GetMapping("/find-id/{id}")
  public ObjectToFind findId(@PathVariable Id id) {
    return new ObjectToFind(id);
  }

  static class ObjectToFind {
    private final String id;

    private ObjectToFind(Id id) {
      this.id = id.toString();
    }

    public String getId() {
      return id;
    }
  }
}
{{</highlight>}}

Note that I expect custom type as an input parameter of the findOne method. If I try to run those
tests it will fail which makes sense because spring has no idea how to handle my Id class. My first
approach, which failed, was to implement Converter interface and register it as a bean. Something
like this:

{{<highlight java>}}
@Component
class IdConverter implements Converter<String, Id> {
  @Override
  public Id convert(String source) {
    return new Id(UUID.fromString(source));
  }
}
{{</highlight>}}

It looks clean. It has single responsibility, doesn't have any state, and is easy to test. It will
work if you start your application using bootRun or if your tests set up full spring context. The
problem is I am too lazy to start the whole application to manually check if my controllers work, or
wait until application context boots up (this requires setting up the DB, configuring tons of other
beans, in general, it takes time).

The problem and the solution are hidden deep in the @WebMvcTest. To be more specific problem is in
the @TypeExcludeFilter registered in the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-test-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/test/autoconfigure/web/servlet/WebMvcTest.java#L75[@WebMvcTest]
If you look into the filter implementation you'll notice classes that are considered to be the part
of
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/master/spring-boot-project/spring-boot-test-autoconfigure/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/test/autoconfigure/web/servlet/WebMvcTypeExcludeFilter.java#L49[web
environment]. Converter nor @Component are not considered to be the part of the web environment. So
now we know why it is not picked up while running tests.

To be honest, my first approach was
https://docs.spring.io/spring/docs/current/javadoc-api/org/springframework/web/bind/annotation/InitBinder.html[@InitBinder]
and ancient https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/beans/PropertyEditor.html[PropertyEditor]
which is not as nice as stateless Converter but it will work:

{{<highlight java>}}
@ControllerAdvice
class ArgumentConverterBinder {
  @InitBinder
  void setupBinder(WebDataBinder binder) {
    binder.registerCustomEditor(Id.class, new IdPropertyEditor());
  }

  private class IdPropertyEditor extends PropertyEditorSupport {
    @Override
    public String getAsText() {
      return getValue() != null
          ? getValue().toString()
          : "";
    }

    @Override
    public void setAsText(String text) throws IllegalArgumentException {
      setValue(new Id(UUID.fromString(text)));
    }
  }
}
{{</highlight>}}

Luckily at some point, it clicked that @ControllerAdvice is basically @Component. Turns out all I
had to do was to change from @Component to @ControllerAdvice and that's all. No more property
editors and no more WebDatabinders :)

First I created the solution with ProeprtyEditor, then after finding out a bit hacky
@ControlerAdvice I've discovered yet another solution to the problem. It is the simplest one from
the developer perspective but requires a lot of "magic" from the spring. All you have to do to have
automatic conversion of raw string passed in http url to your class in a @Controller method
parameter is to create public (that's important) constructor which accepts single String as
parameter. If you are interested in how this works you should take a look at
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/master/spring-core/src/main/java/org/springframework/core/convert/support/ObjectToObjectConverter.java[ObjectToObjectConverter].

It is also worth pointing out that spring do support a lot of types out of the box. Here is the list
of some of the interesting converters registered by default in spring:

{{<highlight text>}}
org.springframework.core.convert.support.StringToEnumConverterFactory
org.springframework.core.convert.support.StringToLocaleConverter
org.springframework.core.convert.support.StringToCharacterConverter
org.springframework.core.convert.support.StringToCurrencyConverter
org.springframework.core.convert.support.StringToPropertiesConverter
org.springframework.core.convert.support.StringToUUIDConverter
org.springframework.core.convert.support.StringToArrayConverter
org.springframework.core.convert.support.StringToCollectionConverter
org.springframework.core.convert.support.StringToTimeZoneConverter
{{</highlight>}}

And a lot of converters for  jsr310 (new date time API) not to mention joda date time converts if
you have joda on the classpath

You can find examples usage converters for some of those converts on my
https://github.com/pchudzik/blog-example-spring-converters/blob/master/src/test/java/com/pchudzik/blog/example/springconverter/BuiltInConvertersControllerTest.java[GitHub].

When I started writing this post I thought I will end it with hacky @ControllerAdvice. Turns out
there is so much more to automagic types conversion available in spring. I'm sure that during my
career I've written at least one or two converters for the types that are now handled by the spring
out of the box. To feel better I keep telling myself that a lot of those converts must've been added
recently, but I'm not sure if I want to check when they've been created ;)
