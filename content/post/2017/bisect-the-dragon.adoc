It all started on Friday, like many of the bad things that can happen in software ;) We've been
working for some time and after being blocked with deployments for a long time (don't ask, you don't
want to know ;)) we were finally able to deploy a new version. Our last release was about week ago.
Do the deployment - seems like the easy thing to do. I've triggered deploy plan on Jenkins and it's
failed. Here is the story how I've fixed something that looked like hours of analysis in few
minutes.

<!--more-->

Long story short, as a part of deployment process the new version is set by Jenkins and it failed.
The output of the build ended with something like this:

Running with debug (-X) wasn't helpful at all. I went through all 5 stages of bug fixing process:

[%hardbreaks]
Denial - I've run the build 2 more times just to be sure ;)
Anger - wtf is going on?
Bargaining - maybe Jenkins is broken I'll run this locally just to be sure
Depression - what has happened and why it is happening to me on Friday?
Challenge accepted - I'm going to find the problem and fix it

Let's skip to the last phase because it was the most productive one...

I've started by investigating git log. A lot of changes... So maybe I'll find changes in pom.xml
files only. Still, more then I'd want to review manually and the team is waiting for the deployment.
Luckily I've decided not to figure this out with an empty stomach. During lunch I've recalled
"exotic" command - git bisect. After checking out google on how to use it I was ready for next
round. Using git bisect I was able to find the problem in a matter of few minutes...

For educational purposes, I've created the very simple project which simulates the process.

Before we start we'll need two commits. First is the bad one - usually top of the HEAD. Second is
good one, for me, it was the last release

Now we can start the hard work ;)

Ok it failed let's tell git about it:

{{<highlight text>}}

Let's check again:

{{<highlight text>}}
pawel@tet:~/Workspace/blog-examples/bisect-the-dragon$ (cd project/ && mvn -q versions:set -DnewVersion=1.0.0)
{{</highlight>}}

It has passed. Ok let's clean up and let git know that it is working now:

{{<highlight text>}}
pawel@tet:~/Workspace/blog-examples/bisect-the-dragon$ git clean -f && git checkout -- .

Now all I have to do is to run the procedure unit git will tell us which commit caused the problem

Ups that's on me :P let's investigate the commit (note that git printed hashes of commits to
compare):

Ok nothing interesting at first glance, but those systemPropertyVariables looks fishy, why do I need
to configure MySQL for tests? Turn's out that colon is a forbidden character in this context. A
pretty lame problem, but it has passed all previous (up to install) phases but version setting...

After finding out broken commit I've decided to read the manual of
https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect[git bisect] and found out that I could've automated the whole
process:

{{<highlight text>}}
pawel@tet:~/Workspace/blog-examples/bisect-the-dragon$ git bisect start
pawel@tet:~/Workspace/blog-examples/bisect-the-dragon$ git bisect bad
pawel@tet:~/Workspace/blog-examples/bisect-the-dragon$ git bisect good 6fd3a3d
Bisecting: 6 revisions left to test after this (roughly 3 steps)
[443afc9780758bcbed101e252a4968ad28d9f202] run tests alphabetical
pawel@tet:~/Workspace/blog-examples/bisect-the-dragon$ git bisect run sh -c "(cd project && mvn versions:set -DgenerateBackupPoms=false -DnewVersion=1.0.0 && git checkout -- .)"
{{</highlight>}}

This will automatically run the whole bug tracking process and pinpoint broken commit automatically.
With this knowledge, I'll be able to work smarter not harder in the future :)

My example was lame and because of that I came up with the git bisect solution but now I see a lot
of potential in this tool and I'm pretty sure it will save me some more time in the future.
