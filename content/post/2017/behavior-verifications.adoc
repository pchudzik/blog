When I've got some free time I try to add new features to
https://blog.pchudzik.com/201707/springmock-v1/[springmock]. Lately, after adding some new stuff I
realized that double definition parsing class has more than one responsibility (class parsing,
naming, definition creation, etc). So I've decided it's time to refactor it and split
responsibilities into dedicated classes. Once I did that and tests in the shared kernel started to
pass I executed mvn verify just to be sure that everything was working and it wasn't...

tl;dr

- don't be afraid to break stuff in the process
- make sure you've got tests that will work during and after the refactoring
- implement few integration/smoke tests which will at least verify the happy path
- refactor one thing at a time
- if you can verify results in your test then _do_ verify the results
- avoid behavior verification especially if what you are verifying are your objects

The story

Since you are probably not familiar with what I'm trying to do let me explain it a little bit. Springmock
allows to register mocks/spies in the spring context created by any mocking library (mockito, spock)
into spring integration test cases. In order to create mock/spy I need to find doubles definitions
and that's when parser comes into play. My parser implementation was responsible for:

- finding all ```@AutowiredMock```/```@AutowiredSpy``` annotations on class and fields
- extracting double details from an annotation
- extracting double configuration from yet another annotation
- creating a double definition based on those details
- creating registry which contains all the definitions and is used later to register doubles in spring

It was good enough in the beginning when all it was doing was finding annotated fields which was
pretty straightforward. Now there is a bit more to it and there is even more on the way. I decided
it is time to split it into more specialized classes. After reviewing existing tests for the module
I felt pretty comfortable with the idea of refactoring the code. At the first glance there was
nothing to change there, except maybe code responsible for the creation of object under test.

The fail

Once I was done with the new class hierarchy I plugged it into existing parser (my first mistake was
here, I should've plug one part at a time and making sure everything works one step a time). I've
executed tests and of course there were failures which I've fixed pretty fast. Everything was green
in the shared kernel module. Then I've executed spock and mockito tests and it was not so green
anymore. About 90% of the tests have failed...

I was able to locate the issue pretty fast:

{{<highlight java>}}
private DoubleDefinition createDoubleDefinition(AnnotationDetails details, Field field) {
  final String doubleName = doubleNameResolver.resolveDoubleName(details, field.getName());
  final Class<?> doubleClass = doubleClassResolver.resolveDoubleClass(details, field.getType());

  final DoubleDefinitionBuilder definitionBuilder = DoubleDefinition.builder()
    .name(doubleName)
    .aliases(details.getAlias())
    .doubleClass(doubleClass);

  details
    .resolveConfiguration(doubleConfigurationResolver)
    .apply(doubleName, field);

  return definitionBuilder.build();
}
{{</highlight>}}

The bug is just before return statement I do create configuration object but I don't add this object
to the ```DoubleDefinition``` and that's the problem. Nothing complicated.

How should I approach the issue? My first idea was to write the test for ```createDoubleDefinition```
but even without digging into the details I can see few problems with this approach.

- it is a private method
- it's not really public interface but more like an implementation detail
- the public interface of this class is not so user-friendly (it accepts ```Class``` and ```Field``` as
  input) so it's not as easy to test as you might think (both ```Class``` and Field are final classes)

Completely ignoring warning signs I started to write some tests for this class and I've noticed two
more issues. Creation of ```DoubleDefinitionFactory``` is a complicated process. This class has
dependencies on other services and is basically responsible for coordinating the work not really
doing it. In order to test it I'll need to create a full class hierarchy, then add some static
classes with fields annotated with ```@AutowiredMock```/```AutowiredSpy``` and then pass those
fields classes to the definition factory (```Class``` and ```Filed``` are final classes so mocking
won't be easy). Alternatively, I can mock all of the external world. I was too lazy to do the first
one. The second doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

The fix

I removed what I've started to write and decided to look for the better place to test it. After a
bit of digging I was surprised to find the test: ```should_parse_mock_configuration_from_field``` So
I've thought about it maybe Maybe I'm not that stupid after all... I started reading it to figure
out why it is not failing:

{{<highlight java>}}
@Test
public void should_parse_mock_configuration_from_field() {
  //given
  final DoubleDefinitionTestConfiguration configurationAnnotation = findAnnotation(
    findField(MockWithConfiguration.class, ANY_SERVICE_NAME),
    DoubleDefinitionTestConfiguration.class);

  //when
  parseClass(MockWithConfiguration.class, configurationParser);

  //then
  Mockito
    .verify(configurationParser)
    .parseMockConfiguration(ANY_SERVICE_NAME, configurationAnnotation);
}
{{</highlight>}}

See the verify call at the end? I'm an idiot after all :P why on earth would you verify interaction
instead of checking out the result? Let's fix the test:

{{<highlight java>}}
//given
final Object configuration = new Object();
final DoubleDefinitionTestConfiguration configurationAnnotation = findAnnotation(
  findField(MockWithConfiguration.class, ANY_SERVICE_NAME),
  DoubleDefinitionTestConfiguration.class);
Mockito
  .when(configurationParser.parseMockConfiguration(ANY_SERVICE_NAME, configurationAnnotation))
  .thenReturn(configuration);

//when
final DoubleRegistry doubleRegistry = parseClass(MockWithConfiguration.class, configurationParser);

//then
assertThat(
  doubleRegistry.mocks(),
  hasItem(doubleWithConfiguration(configuration)));
{{</highlight>}}

Finally it's failing as it should from the begging. The moral of the story is that you should avoid
interaction verifications especially if you can simply check the result. Yet another moral of the
story is the more powerful tools you have the more cautious you should be when using them because
it's too easy to do stuff you normally wouldn't do.
