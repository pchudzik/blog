Imagine the situation when you've just released something on production and deployment went fine.
You've just sent release notes and went out to grab a coffee. Once you are back you see an email
with information that feature team have been working on for past 3 sprints doesn't work at all.
Turns out you forgot to change something in production server configuration. In this post, I'm going
to present the simplest idea which will help you to avoid this kind of issues.

*tl;dr* - Create RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md make sure it is up to date and keep it in your code repository
to code review it.

In the perfect world, everything should be automated and everything should be done by scripts so you
can do the continuous delivery of your product. Unfortunately we don't live in perfect world and
sometimes we are just still getting there... Automation might be very hard or impossible to achieve
or maybe you've decided to do this one thing manually just this one time... (Luckily with containers
automation is getting easier and easier so hopefully this post will get outdated really soon :))

To make sure that everything that is required is done after the release you can try to put
everything in your head... Or you can create a plain text file with the list of things that you must
do after the version X is deployed on the server. In this file, you should put all the manual steps
that must be done before/during/after the release. With a bit of luck it will be empty, but
sometimes there are things that you didn't have a chance to automate yet or are one-timers that you
believe will not happen in the future.

In my old team, we had this stinky link:/post/2017/checklist-txt/sharepoint.jpg[SharePoint] stuff
that we've been managing manually for some time and it was very challenging for us to track what we
must do to make it work after the release. The ultimate solution was to automate the process (which
we eventually did after we discovered how boring, annoying and error prone it was :)). A temporary
solution was plain (almost ;)) text file which looked something like this:

{{<highlight text>}}

# 3.11 - not yet released

- In list X and add required column of type Y
- In list Z and remove column K
- In library N change default view to include attribute O

# already released

## 3.10 - released 21.11.2017

- Do something
- Do something else

{{</highlight>}}

We kept the history of the changes in the file. We needed to do those changes on our local machines
as well and when you were on vacation you might've problems setting up your local environment after
being off the project for some time.

We started with wiki page but after few failures, we noticed that author usually knows exactly what
must be done, but the release manager (fancy name, but it was just the person who was handling the
release process) might not know the context and therefore might not understand what author had in
mind. Or even worse author might have forgotten to update the wiki page...

Once we slipped on it few times we decided that it will not work this way. Our solution was simple.
Move wiki page to the git repo. Once the file is in the repo you have easy access to the history,
but what was more important this file become part of our code base and therefore part of the
process. We reviewed it like any other part of the code. It was the simplest way of ensuring that
the author created instructions and that other people understand it. Once we migrated it to VCS we
were able to notice when author forgot to update the file while changing something in the code.
After some time we also implemented the rule that author of the change must not deploy his change on
dev environment. We wanted to make sure that those instructions were clear and easy to follow for a
person without the background in particular change (we had "complicated" release process and we were
unable to release as often as we'd like to).

The solution is stupid simple but it worked for us just fine up until the point we were able to
automate the most troublesome parts of the process.
