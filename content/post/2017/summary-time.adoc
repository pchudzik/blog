I left company for which I've been working for last 4 years and now it is time to summarize my
experiences. It is not story of shady business nor confession of my sins (not all of it anyway), but
rather my thoughts and experiences on working for long time in the same company from which most of
the time remotely.

<!--more-->

I started as a java developer and my first task was to create tool which will be able to import data
into the system under active development. There was no time to do it manually before product was due
on production because it was already late and there was no chance to deploy it early enough. It was
actually great way of onboarding. I was able to get familiar with all the technologies used in the
project, figure out available APIs and was guided very smoothly to produce working solution. +
_Lesson learned good onboarding will produce not so confused employee :)_

Meanwhile there was problem with UI development and it was the time when I've learned that it's
possible to do something more useful then failing snowflakes in javascript ;) I've learned angular
and all the tooling around it. With the help of the team we picked up frontend and were able to
deliver it on time. +
_Lesson learned never leave anyone without supervision for too long especially when time is crucial.
Ask what is going on and expect results. If there is nothing for too long then it is time to act._

Now we were good functional team. There were some personal changes but we were able to keep good
atmosphere and idea of good quality in mind. After first release (which wen smoothly) new project
was on the horizon... +
_Lesson learned if everything is working do not cut in into the process._

In the meantime I've decided to go 100% remote (team was scattered all across Poland) from my
perspective there was no reason to commute to the office since I was working remotely already.
Thanks to understanding PM it was possible and company allowed it. At first I was little afraid that
I will not be able to work effectively from home but with a bit of practice I was able to pull it
off and it worked just fine. First of all I had my office hours and I've tried to stick to it. I had
my workplace. When I was there I was working when I was not I was out of the office. This small
procedure allowed to foul my brain into thinking now you are in the office do your job. I also had
my morning, lunch and afternoon routines which allowed to easily get in and out of the office. +
_Lesson learned when working remotely have your routines which will get you into "you
are in the office, do your job" state._

Some time after I went remote new project was assigned to our team (we already had two on production
in the maintenance mode with new feature to developed once in a while). It was the first project in
which  my role was something more then just regular developer. I was heavily involved in the
planning process and then I've leveled up to something more like a tech leader. Although I was
expected to lead and point the direction I always discussed my ideas with the team. Before anything
was decided I looked for confirmation from the team that it is something they want. Usually I was
able to sell my idea and it was accepted. Sometimes team convinced me to do something in a bit
different way (I was the stubborn one ;)) or implement something using new technology. +
_Lesson learned don't force your ideas just because they are yours. Talk about them, argue, discus
and listen to other members of the team and eventually everything will land just fine._

Technologies used in this project were http://imgur.com/qZA9Cow[not developer friendly] but with
a bit of the effort we were able to isolate ourselves from it. For the first release it wasn't yet
perfect but it was working. On some level of abstraction you didn't care what was below and after
initial fuss with this technology we almost forgot what was below :) For the next release we took it
to the next level and developed some extra tooling aroung it and now it was almost to good to be
possible :) +
_Lesson learned let the team improve the process._

Not everything was so shiny there were also failures. From my perspective the biggest one is
agreeing to do the project with the tools which were not optimal for the job. I should've come up
with ideas on what can be done about it and discuss them more aggressively with architects. +
_Lesson learned don't give up easily, figure out the ideas to solve the problem and maybe you will
be able to change the course of the river. If not you'll not regret that you didn't try hard
enough._

We were still maintaining two older systems. The oldest one started to look a bit like legacy
software... It was time to do something about it. I was able to sell the idea of refactoring it
which allowed new team members to get familiar with it. We refactored frontend which was developed
by backend developers learning angular 1.1 without frontend developer supervision. It was far from
good. Refactoring sprints allowed the team to dig into the system and get a bit more comfortable
with it. +
_Lesson learned make sure everyone in the team knows a little about a lot._

We all were working 100% remote (not offline, but remote, we had office hours and daily meetings).
There is nothing wrong with remote team. There are challenges but with proper management and
communication it is possible to have very efficient remote team of developers. It is important to
communicate and discuss a lot of stuff. You should get familiar with the team, figure out what
people like to do and what they avoid, let them pick tasks they want to do. It might be a bit of the
bump at the beginning but this investment pays off quickly once you notice that every person of the
team can do anything and you can go on long vacation and don't be bothered with work. +
_Lesson learned working remotely does work and produce results._

During those 4 years I've been working with great people. We had some harder moments and a lot of
good ones. We did pair programming. We organized mini hackathon. We spend a lot of time discussing
ideas. We exchanged countless number of comments on code review and we produced good quality
software :)
