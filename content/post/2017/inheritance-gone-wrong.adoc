We all know how inheritance works and implemented some kind of class hierarchy at least few times
during our career. Some of us know already that inheritance is not the silver bullet. Some of us
know that inheritance must not be overused and considered with caution. Now I'm going to show you
how choosing the quick win might cost you some unexpected troubles in the future.

I've been watching presentation https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=llGgO74uXMI[Core Design Principles
for Software Developers by Venkat Subramaniam]. Venkat talked about great stuff (long one but worth
watching) and one thing he mentioned struck me hard because I did something similar and didn't even
notice what I really did :)

First, let's take a look at the https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html[Stack]
java class, now after reading the Javadoc and ignoring the tip from the JDK developers let's see how
we can make it bleed:

{{<highlight java>}}
@Test
public void will_push_element_to_the_head_of_the_stack() {
  //given
  final Stack<String> stack = new Stack<String>();

  //when
  stack.push("a");
  stack.push("b");

  //then
  assertEquals(
    asList("a", "b"),
    new ArrayList<String>(stack));

  //when
  stack.add(0, "y");

  //then
  assertEquals(
    asList("y", "a", "b"),
    new ArrayList<String>(stack));
}
{{</highlight>}}

Wait what? Since when the stack is random access collection? Stack is First In First Out collection how
can you set something as the end of the stack? The answer is in the Javadoc. `Stack<E> extends
Vector<E>`. Vector is not as restrictive as stack and you can perform not stack like operations on it
like, for example, add an element at any position.

What can I do about it? Well the obvious solution is to read the
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/Stack.html[javadoc]:

____
A more complete and consistent set of LIFO stack operations is provided by the Deque interface and
its implementations, which should be used in preference to this class
____

But seriously. Choose carefully what you are
inheriting (like the property with an enormous mortgage which will eat all your savings) and remember
that what is inherited will be available to the users.

The obvious solution, in this case, will be: do not inherit from the vector. But the vector has all
the functionality required by the stack. The answer is - delegate. Instead of extending vector and
exposing all not stack like operation to the user hide your implementation inside and delegate what
you need the _private_ vector in the Stack class. Now users can see only push and pop methods (and
whatever you'll show them) and you can change how it's implemented any time you want.

Delegating all the methods is boring stuff, There must be a better way to do it you might think.
Sure there is as Venkat mentioned you can use IntelliJ IDEA which will do the hard work for you and
will generate all the boring stuff.

Another solution to the problem is to depend on the behavior, not on the implementation. If only
stack was an interface then we will not be able to use add method which is defined in the Vector
class (unless you'll do some other weird hacks like casting etc).

The moral of the story is this: choose carefully what you extend and make sure that your class
behavior is aligned with what you are extending and always remember that inheritance is complex
stuff. There is yet another lesson. We all make mistakes and it's ok. Just remember to make them
only once. Remember try not to violate your stack too much :)
